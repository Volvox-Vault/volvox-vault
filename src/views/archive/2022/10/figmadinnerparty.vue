            <p>
             
Leah Maldonado and I met on a calm winter day for a glamorous Figma Dinner Party, and conversed about our hearts.
<br>
“I’ve lived in Portland for a really 
long time, which maybe isn’t the norm of the people who are here now. I feel really connected with Oregon in general, and the natural world here a lot. I love where I’m from, I think that’s a huge part of my identity. 
I work as a graphic designer and make artwork as a type-designer. I made Glyphworld, which I think is my one hit wonder. It’s actually not one hit, it’s a full album. There’s lots of fonts within that typeface. So that’s kind of like my claim to fame. I’ve made other typefaces, but they haven’t really received the same type of attention as my star child — which is Glyphworld, who I’m beginning to kind of hate a little too. Glyphworld is like, growing up, they’re not a cute baby anymore. 
Besides type, I also enjoy doing performance art, or like, workshop/interactive art that requires a group of people in a classroom or some collaborative setting where we learn something together. And the output of that feels kind of like an art piece that we all share. So yeah, that’s who I am,” 
she said. 
<br>
Leah and I both have a strong affection for collaborative art, so I was excited to collaborate with her over our Figma Dinner Party. She has a really vibrant and playful collection of work and personality, so I had a lot of questions prepared to cook up and savour with her. 
<br>
“What is the relationship between love and design for you?” I asked.
<br>
She began drawing a circle, as if setting out all the ingredients of our dinner. She chopped up a venn-diagram to compare Love to Design.
“I wish I was way faster in Figma… So this is the Love circle and this is like Design. I’m sorry, but I need time to make it perfect.”
<br>
“It’s OK, cooking takes time!”
<br>
“Cooking does take time… These are a little bit, you know, not centred in the middle, but that’s okay. That’s a stylistic choice I’m making here. I think your question is, ‘What lies in  the overlapping area for me?’—and currently, I have been trying to think as if there is no such thing as that intersection, because when I started out in my career, like in school, this was my venn-diagram...”
<br>
She moves the circles to overlap.

“When I was more in control of what I would use design for, and my professors would give me interesting briefs and stuff, and the briefs were all about just growing my knowledge and making me better. Then, when I started my career, I kind of entered with a perspective like, ‘well, everything can’t be perfect, but it’s probably gonna be like this (Love and Design overlapping).’ It was stupid of me to think that a workplace could offer that venn diagram. It actually just made it so the center of this diagram was: abuse of my time.
I was so fresh, new, and willing to do everything to the best of my freaking possible ability. I was treating every-thing like a thesis… It may have made me a great worker, that would work overtime all the time and stuff, but I put everything into things that were meaningless.
So I’ve had a huge reaction to that, and I’ve been feeling like there is no intersection. But maybe there is an intersection between Love and Art or Creative Output. For me now, I’m feeling like Design = Work—I used to think Design = Artwork. I think it’s a bad use of your innate urge to create artwork, to funnel it into a brand solely for validation. Instead, you should probably funnel it as a medium to express something to the world. 
Like in art, I’m always really thankful for the way canons have preserved certain things. I’m also really critical of the canon. I think that the act of putting a canon on art and asking, ‘What is high/acceptable art?’ closes off the spectrum to a lot of good stuff that’s probably out there. 
But all of that preservation towards artwork that we consider artwork (whereas an ad campaign is not considered art) has been so helpful for us to communicate with the past, in order to maybe understand some type of future.
At the time that an artist was making something, I’m sure that it was a way for them to deal with their present. So art becomes this emotional timeline of how we’ve always felt, or how that canon has always felt. Whereas, if you were to overlay that timeline with a timeline of only ad campaigns, it would probably show us a whole separate set of emotions.
Like, I actually don’t know if German Expressionism found its way into advertising. I have no idea. Maybe there is some correlation there because I’m sure that there’s plenty of correlation now, like artwork constantly finds its way into ad campaigns, since basically the only lucrative job for an artist is to go work in advertising.
So, the big difference between Design and Artwork is Money. But some people will find a way to make plenty of money with artwork. So I’m not necessarily saying facts, just my opinion.
In the start of my career I was working incompatible jobs, it was really difficult for me to give into another person’s imagination and become a human cursor for that. I wish that they would have just learned the tools and done it themselves.”
<br>
She garnished her venn-diagams as I nodded in agreement.

<p>
<br>
“What things in your life overlap with Love right now?”
<br>
“Honestly, super corny stuff. I love my Family. I guess in the center of that is quality social time. While I don’t love all my family, the family that I do love gives me the best social time ever. 
Also, basic stuff like TV, quality entertainment time, and Dinner. Yeah, I love dinner.”
<br>
“Oh yeah.”
<br>
“I’m definitely obsessed with stuff, like fixated on things, but I’m trying hard not to tell myself that that’s love. It’s too much, to hyper-focus on something for too long, because I’ll ignore other stuff. I’ll forget to drink water or I’ll forget to text somebody back. It’s really important that I do that.
I think love is really powerful. I’m a little scared of it. So I only want to give it to things that are like—maybe I should take off TV. That’s bad.”
<br>
With a change of heart, she tended to the TV venn-diagram as if it was burning to the point of setting off the Figma fire alarms. I waved my digital towel at them.
<br>
“I mean, in moderation it can be refreshing for sure. Even though Love and Work or Design don’t overlap, it still plays a part in the balance of feeling joy and enjoying life.
What does that boundary feel like right now, with balancing everything else that is important?”
<br>
“So, over time.” 
<br>
Leah turned her attention to another portion of our Figma counter-top, and  started making digital noodles that gestalted into a graph.
</p>
<div class="imgBox">
              <img
                style="border-radius: 30px"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.global/31c7994a-ff45-4592-b835-14262460c504/Group%206.png?v=1663889864975"
              />
</div>
<p>
“Are we saying like, this is Time and this is Love?”
<br>
She labeled the axes of the graph.
<br>
“Then we’re putting it in the world of Free Time—or maybe this isn’t Love, maybe this is Interest… Now I’m just making up the question.”
<br>
“Please cook! Make the recipe your own,” I insisted.
<br>
“I found the spice cabinet and I’m just throwing stuff in.”
<br>
“Please make yourself at home.”
<br>
“Okay. If this (left-most of the x axis) is when I was born and this (right-most of the y axis) is when I’m going to die... I’m going to start from the end. 
I hope that right before I die, I give my maximum energy to my interests. Since I won’t have any more time after that to do it. But, before I die, I hope that I spend time with things that aren’t my interests. Like, I’ll still pay attention to some stuff, like my family, but I won’t give everything to them. 
In my senior years, I hope that I will have a seasonal fluctuation with interests. Maybe this (highest points) is summer times spent alone doing what I like. Or with a partner that it feels like being alone with, you know. Then, this (low points) is the holidays or something where I just have to see everybody.
Then, I hope that right before I go in to my old years, I let go of all interests. So maybe I can make new ones. 
When I was a child, anything that interested me I gave my full energy to, and it was just downhill from there.” 
<br>
We both laughed at the truth she was depicting in her pixel noodles. Leah asked me,
<br>
“Would you give anyone advice on how to avoid a steep, downward path? Like look, we’re not going to promise that you won’t go downhill, but maybe we can give some people advice on how to do a more stepped approach?”
<br>
“I feel that community helps a lot. If you’re in life alone, that’s especially difficult. But if you find connections where you are pretty consistently inspired by the people around you, and it reignites motivation, it cushions the fall.”
<br>
“What about advice for that vertical downfall, any advice for dark times?”
<br>
“I think people always say that their most creative ideas come out of their worst experiences. So maybe take notes while you’re in that dark time. Like, why is this so terrible right now? How could this become my next big thing? For me, at one of my first real jobs that I was really excited for, the boss ended up being a really strange person. I felt very stuck in life. But a couple years later, I ended up writing a script that I really liked. Basically, the main character of it was this terrible out of touch boss who was really fun to fictionally write and read about.
So I was like, ‘I’m glad that getting to know that terrible thing helped something.’ Remembering that it’s all a part of the cycle helps.”
<br>
“Yeah. I really resonate with writing a script based on your life. I think that’s so funny. I would love to read that script. Like a table read is the perfect COVID hangout.
But yeah, I would suggest writing things down. Or using that time to start planning your art project, maybe that can even help you regress a little bit, like, I think planning is really helpful.
You don’t have to do anything, you just have to plan it and it feels kind of good to plan it. Even if you don’t do it. So it’s like a way to trick yourself, is to just start planning.  
And besides journaling, I think you could do other things that aren’t word related, you know, it could be recording in any way.
But also maybe just feeling it. Like, I’ve stopped just hitting the pillow and closing my eyes. Now I have to force my eyes closed, like I’ll read or look at my phone until I close my eyes. But I think I should probably just go to bed and close my eyes, let myself think for a second uninterrupted, and have that force me to fall asleep. In those moments, I think we process a lot of that scary stuff, but it’s good to think about it. Maybe it’s a little too scary for some people, so be careful.”
<br>
“Yeah. Building on that, spending time in nature helps. Where I live now, it’s really easy to go to a waterfall. Just being in a forested area, you get into that moment before bed headspace. Where it’s just your thoughts and everything turns off. It’s a little less scary when you’re in a forest. Things feel a little more zoomed out, so maybe that’s a good warmup.
What do you tend to follow in life, your heart or your mind?”
<br>
“I really think I follow my heart and that leads me into situations where I need to control how much of my heart I follow in certain things and remove it from the situation.
I think it’s really difficult to not be emotional about stuff. As logical as I think I am, I really am not. I’m so emotionally-minded. I don’t know what the fact is, I just go on my gut feeling. Do you think that you’re more mind over heart?”
<br>
“I’m probably more heart over mind. And for you, even though you said 
Love doesn’t overlap with Work, maybe we can imagine a map where your Heart’s in the middle, and then the force field around it with protection. How far do you keep work and other things away from it?”
<br>
“Yeah. Okay, I’ll make a diagram.”
<br>
She brought out a digital rolling pin and streched out three doughy digital layers. Then she started dressing it.
<br>
“So you have your Heart in the middle. Then things that you love, and things that you keep your heart at a little bit of a distance from. Okay. I’m trying to make this, but it’s kind of like failing a little bit, so let’s see...
Okay, this is good enough. The closest thing I keep to my heart is probably my emotions. Farther from that would be judgements. Well, I try my best to keep what I perceive other people think about me—or my negative perceptions of myself—away from my heart. I think that my heart is like my life force. And actually, LOVE is really close to my heart, but separate from the machine.
I don’t know what would be in the middle layer. Maybe my friends, I think having boundaries with friends is probably good practice. But I am the type of person that believes a friend could become family, definitely at a certain point.”
<br>
“Yeah, I think similarly.”
<br>
I stretched out my heart dough and decorated it too, with strong inspiration from Leah’s, as I resonated.
</p>

              />

<p>
“I have another category that I’m curious about. You know how some people say, ‘from the bottom of my heart.’ If that is a different section, it’s kind of independent of the layers. What do you think is at the bottom of your heart?”
<br>
“Oh man. Probably the Tao, if I get into the spiritual things that keep me going when it feels like there’s nothing of me left—it feels like there’s just the universe, and just that luckiness of being a part of this speck of the universe that can experience itself, you know? So I would say: being.”
<br>
“Yeah, I’m going to kind of copy you. Instead of being, I will say luck. I think right now I’m so lucky to be here, and I’m glad that I’m in this time. I’m glad that I’m of this time, even though it’s a crazy time. If I was born maybe just 40 years before I would have never seen—or I guess we would have—nevermind. I think there’s no time that we could have been born that would protect us from scary sickness. I don’t know. It seems a little scarier than other times in my life, but maybe it’s just because of my age. Like, do you think little kids are really, really, really afraid of COVID, or they don’t understand?”
<br>
“I don’t know that they understand it. Sometimes I’ll remember my brain as a kid, and there was definitely a lot of anxiety. I think the social pressure when you’re a kid is like your whole world, and that feels similar to virus anxiety sometimes.”
<br>
“Yeah. I can resonate with that.”
<br>
“What about you, what’s the contrast between your kid brain and your now brain?”
<br>
“Sometimes I feel like I’ve held onto a lot of the neuroses that I developed as a child. I haven’t let them go, and instead polished them and made them grow old with me.
I think I’m a hypochondriac now and I was a hypochondriac when I was a child. A child could believe in really fantastical stuff, while both totally believe in things that could never happen to me. But now I believe I could have a rare cancer that only 1% of the whole world gets, which is as fantastical as believing that the watermelon seed I swallowed will turn into a tree in my stomach. They’re like the same thing, but one is the adult version. I’m like a little girl underneath it all. So actually, at the bottom of my heart it’s a child.”
<br>
Leah finished decorating her heart dough and we put it in our Figma oven.
<br>
“Yeah, that’s good. Speaking of friends on this other tier, how do you show your friends or family that you love them?”

<br>“I really love to cook for my friends. Like honestly, we had a big dinner party and I had so much fun planning out the oven times. I was basically doing my own version of Thanksgiving planning for my 12 person dinner party, preparing and laying out the food, and then presenting the food to my friends. Having this very-formal-giving during my birthday, that they would have to be so kind and thankful to receive, because it’s my birthday. (laughs) So, it was a little bit of a selfish thing. 
I also think that playing is a way that I really like to show love to my friends. I have only ever thrown themed parties. A party without rules is a little too scary for me to try to throw. I’ll go to one, but I don’t think I could just throw a party with the theme of: just have fun naturally. What I’m trying to say is that I kind of struggle with natural socialization, and I love it when my friends can indulge me in my attempts to indulge them. 
With my family, I think that all of those boundaries go away, and my family doesn’t fucking care if I’m having a good social time or not. It’s more like, maybe family is about arguing without there being a consequence. Not about anything so negative, but just about the world. Just being able to be 1000% honest with my family, and tease and bully people a little. We sound like we’re awful, but it’s nice to be able to share that honesty and humor with people, without it leading to someone hating you or something.
So that’s how I show my love to my family and friends. There’s more ways too, like hugs and kisses.”
<br>
“Yeah, classic. It’s interesting how the closer it gets to the heart, the more tension that builds as well.”
<br>
“Yeah. Well, I think that I’m a little bit of a cold person, so I guess the closer you get to my heart, the colder it might feel. But hopefully you like the cold. There’s definitely people who hate too much warmth, and I don’t know how you feel about that, but I certainly do not get along with people that are a little bit not analytical or critical enough.”
<br>
“Are you a Virgo at all too? Because I’m a Virgo rising, and I resonate with that area of things.” 
<br>
“Yeah, that’s exactly what I am.”
<br>
“Great, so that’s just basically what this all narrows down to then.”
<br>
“Yeah, and then I’m a Leo sun on top of it. So I feel like it’s a special type of psychopath. Like, not only am I cold, but I will say it really loud.” 
<br>
“Right, that’s powerful though.”
<br>
“Powerful is a nice word, I think other people have said mean.”
<br>
“No! Like, I’m a Libra sun on top 
of my Virgo rising, so we’re pretty compatible there. Because Libras are known to be a bit indecisive, so whenever I meet a decisive person I’m like, ‘Wow, it’s amazing that you can decide that, and say it out loud.’
Anyways, Is there anyone whose warm-heartedness has impacted how you live and work?”
<br>
“My teacher, Kate Bingaman-Burt, at Portland State University is probably that person. She kind of teaches from the Sister Corita Kent rules, which are really important to me now too.
Maybe at the root of it all is Sister Corita Kent, or whoever taught her, which I fear is a bit too religiousy for my taste now, but filtered through Kate. I’m so glad to have had that person in my life because she showed me the benefit of fostering community. Leaning into chaotic stuff and trying not to worry so much. Some people, when they to tell you not to worry, they might actually mean: stop caring and relax by avoiding or not doing so much. But Kate Bingaman-Burt was like, don’t worry about all of this stuff that you have to do, make a to-do list. And I really liked that. It was really helpful to have an example of somebody who was like, there’s no task that you can’t not try to do.
She affected me and my cohort of peers in similar ways. So, I’m really thankful to be a piece of that little cast of people that was the community she was fostering. She’s very expressive, a yell talker, which I really respect.
Then, Sister Corita Kent. I’ll actually find the rules right now… So, she had an art class in a church around the ‘70s. She was kind of kicked out of the church, because I think her art class started to surpass the (Catholic) churchy stuff. So then it just became an art class, but… I should say Sister Corita Kent is super into God. Like, she really believes in God. Which is fine. It’s something I’ve totally seen in a lot of artists, because I had to do the typical art history classes and basically learn about Catholicism through an art history lens.
But I think anything spiritual that compels people to do more than their human capacity is cool and worth looking at. Whether that is people who believe that they are possessed by something or people who are very religious and are doing it out of piety or faith, or even people who become faithful to things that aren’t higher powers… I don’t know, I guess at the beginning I was saying the opposite, but maybe people who become super faithful to making money start to create spiritual work too… You know, when an artist is at the height of their career and they’re getting the most money that they’ve ever had, and then they make new work and are building this crazy, crazy thing? I think that’s probably them connecting with something. 
I want to share Kate Bingaman-Burt’s work. I’ll share her drawings. 
She has this practice where she
compulsively draws everything that she buys. When I met her, that was her claim to fame.
It was really interesting, because while she does this illustration, and this is her illustration style, I started to realize that being a designer could be really different. Like, who you were as a designer could be very different from who you were as a visual outputer, artist, creative, like whatever that title could be. I don’t know if this picture or anything that she’s drawn represents the type of artists that she is to me. I think you’d have to go to her class to experience that version of her. Maybe that’s why I really want to find her face. Okay, here’s her face. I think that this kind of helps sum it up.”
<br>
Leah brought out these images from our Figma oven, and uncovered them carefully. Their comforting aromas spread throughout the whole room.

“That’s incredible. How do you get your heart in the right place before getting creative when you’re doing something for fun or art?”
<br>
“I think I need to become obsessed with something before I can really make work about it. I think my public output is what I was obsessed with, which was getting to know Photoshop and making something in the program that was so shiny, shining back at me. It was so satisfying to have a computer screen playback, in full brightness, the colours that I was putting down on the canvas. To be getting better and better with my tool, then grabbing new tools and using those and getting even better. Then I started to get a little bit disgusted by all of the maximalism. I started to struggle with letterforms, and finding time outside of work and yada yada. So my obsession with that tool kind of faded away, and overlapped with my new obsession with learning, or the pursuit of teaching.
<br>
I was trying to teach a class, and I thought that it was cool to write lectures, and now I’m kind of obsessed with writing, but I don’t really publish a lot of that on my channels. I have my journal that I keep, I’m on are.na, but a lot of the writing I do is misspelt gibberish in my notebook. I love that stuff. I don’t know if that will ever be public work, but it’s definitely my practice right now. To get my heart in the right place to do that just means not setting some ritual like, ‘every day for 15 minutes, I have to turn on my journal!’ I kind of have to procrastinate for a really long time, and then hyper fixate on it for six hours. That’s a perfect place for me to be.”
<br>
“I am glad you said that, it’s re-assuring. That’s what I did today too.”
<br>
“What did you fixate on?”
<br>
“I spent like six hours on Tik-Tok or something, you know, which I re-downloaded, which has been hell. Then I transcribed some interviews.”
<br>
“How many times have you deleted Tik-Tok?”
<br>
“A couple times… I’m letting myself have it right now. Something in me is like, ‘you’re allowed to have this right now.’ and that’s perfectly fine with me.
Like you said, any task can get done. I have my to-do list, I’m knocking things off of it, so that’s good. But I think a lot of people strive for the perfect schedule, but maybe the perfect schedule is a chaotic one. Is that a process you’ve come to peace with, or?”
<br>
“Oh, hell no. I wish I was like a robot. I’m also trying to treat Tik-Tok like it’s something I need to be sober from, because I had a really bad issue with Tik-Tok and have deleted it countless times, only to download it again. I was clocking a lot of hours on Tik-Tok. I don’t even want to say.”
<br>
“I think a lot of people can relate.”
<br>
“It was really bad and took away whole days of mine. I had to use it for research at work, so I’ve tried to stop.” 
<br>
“That’s the worst.”
<br>
“Yeah, It’s super the worst, but it’s really crazy to have been in control of some things on Tik-Tok. Like, to make Bretman Rock do something. At one point I was the puppet master of Bretman Rock.”
<br>
“What! Can you explain?”
<br>
“Well, at Nike, or any other large brand, often they aren’t doing anything with their own brand’s Tik-Tok page.
Those are kind of like placeholders just to have something. What they really do is work with influencers and creators to support campaigns, and use hashtags and stuff like that. So we’ll reach out to some type of influencer, whoever they might be, and use them as ads. Which I think is consensual with some people who seek to be influencers, but I don’t know if it will ever be consensual with the generations who follow those people. Like children that are online, and such. I think the pursuit of fame is a completely non-consensual urge that we all have now because of our platforms, and it feels really bad. I’m very afraid for the generation after the one that’s in college right now, or the youth right now! I hope that the internet explodes.” 
<br>
“Boom! ...Fame is a whole thing.”
<br>
“Definitely. I think I got really, really far away from your original question.”
<br>
“That’s OK! It’s interesting too. What was my original question… getting your heart in the right place to be creative. I think we’ve stemmed from that somehow, I guess it relates to those wild passions that our hearts get stuck on, such as fame.
I feel like in the generation before me, Pop was about celebrities, like Mary Kate and Ashley, and it was like, they’re the celebrity and I’m the person. Like, yes I have that urge to be famous, but it’s such a separate world. But now with all these channels, like YouTube and Tik-Tok, it feels more and more accessible, but it’s not necessarily, and it’s like… what’s happening?
Anyways, you said you’ve deleted Tik-Tok a bunch. What has your ego journey been with social media? Especially since you work in it, you can’t delete the app from your phone because you’re working with it.”
<br>
“Now I try to look at social media as my job, and keep my person-hood really separate from it. I even lean into it if I have to, because I totally accept that the only way to become a successful artist or do things that require crowd participation is to maintain some type of crowd. 
I feel as though, specifically in the type world, I hold some type of crowd that’s small enough that I feel like I can owe them something and deliver on that thing. It’s small enough where I can withhold anything, and maybe be silent forever, and no one would be mad at me or be like, ‘did you die?’
I also enjoy one-on-one email correspondence with people that I respect. I think that’s better than any type of following that you could amass, these heart-to-heart relationships that you have with people that you respect in the world. Which leads to a whole different digital social network, but de-platformed. Maybe it’s like the social network of email.
I’ve asked myself a few times, ‘do I need to get a Tik-Tok to stay relevant?’ and my answer is, ‘well, I have one, and I definitely make really stupid content, but I don’t think I’ll get to a point where I’m going to make content about type in a serious way.’ I don’t think I’ll participate in that platform publicly. I’ll probably let myself die with Instagram and not ever pursue more followers than what I have now.
When I was graduating school, I realized that I would have a higher chance of getting a good paying job if I had more followers. And I was also trying to make Glyphworld into this thing that would become a golden egg that people would hire me for having.
So I was hashtagging my work and that felt like, I dunno—I’m gonna use this word and I mean it in a really neutral way, for its definition—but I felt like I was being a bit of a whore, and I’m just really aware of that. I think it was okay at that time.
And it’s always okay to be a bit of an attention whore, if you need it. Because attention can become rent, your salary, or health insurance. As an artist community, we should continue to support each other needing attention on these platforms, and understand that it’s totally okay to need to be an attention whore. But I do think that it’s good to be critical of it. Only in a way that would protect people. I think it’s too much to turn your whole self into an ad space, but you can make a lot of money doing that. So if you need money that’s okay. But you should be careful about doing that. It can be really dangerous. At some point I think it’s important to set some limits.
I think sometimes brands will require that you have like this set of  unspoken requirements. I think it’s a lot easier to get a job in general where they don’t look at your resume for that long. If you have an Instagram with over 30K followers, you’ll get a job. Even if you’re not proficient in the skills needed to do the job. I also think though, if you have like 250 followers, people might actually pay you more than people with more followers, to do a job that requires skill. But to do any job that requires communication or becoming an ad space for a bigger audience or something like that—just buy followers, you’ll make money.”
<br>
The water on our Figma stove was boiling over, so I turned the heat to medium and added our pixel noodles that Leah made earlier.
<br>
“So, since you went through the Glyph-world phase, whoring yourself, and now on the other side of it­­—where would you say you are now?”
<br>
“I think I accomplished my goal with Glyphworld to canonize myself in the modern typographic design zeitgeist.
<br>
Maybe not history, I don’t know what will be preserved or if I will remain part of the conversation, but I did what I wanted. I wanted a seat at the table of the type-world, and I wanted to have my own seat, a seat that I designed for myself. One of expertise that I could talk about, and I didn’t have to pretend to be the people that were already sitting at the table. So I feel as though I was able to infiltrate and achieve my goal and now I’m so lucky.
I could kill my digital self and I would still have a salary and professional life. I know enough people now behind closed doors to not have to have that public persona, and to be respected while not having an Instagram. I think it’s kind of really similar to being a whore—I think that money is the difference between being seen as a business person or a whore; but, both are the same thing in a way.
Again, let me say that I’m trying to use the word whore as not a bad word. I don’t want to be offensive to anybody or anything, but I really just believe that the definition of that is fine.”
The noodles were a perfect al dente, Leah strained them in our Figma sink.
<br>
“I think a lot of people coming out of university or school have the energy of like, ‘okay, now I gotta get into the career,’ and feel that pressure behind not having that network yet. So you wonder how you’re going to make that network? You don’t know how that’s going to work out. So everyone’s like, begging on their hands and knees for something—putting their all into something a little naive. There’s some naiveness in it, but it’s an essential part of the process.”
<br>
“I think that begging is a very valid technique, starting out on your hands and knees will work.”
<br>
“At least a little bit.”
<br>
“Yeah. It’ll get you there.”
We started on the broth for our noodles, adding a bunch of what Leah had chopped up earlier to a big pot.
<br>
“Thinking about the designs and art that you share to your social media, are they as fun to make as they are to look at?”
Leah stirred the contents of the pot around and around energetically.
<br>
“There’s so many things that the computer can do with me that make it so fun to do. The way the computer can mix colors is very different from the way analogue mediums do.
Like, I can set a brush’s transparency setting to screen or luminance. Which blends colors in a whole new way that only the computer could do with me. And I think that’s part of why I enjoy it so much. There were outcomes that continuously surprised me, because I was learning the tool as I was making the work.
A lot of that process is about hitting this type of realism or a polished feeling that it evolved into. It starts off kind of blobby, and over time and layers, it starts to look more like I rendered it in a 3d program, but the whole time I’m just using Photoshop.
 The lettering part too – It’s one thing to make letter forms in black and white, and those can look so good in black and white, but it’s another thing to put the third dimension onto them and wonder, are they made of like a soft texture? ‘What material are they made out of, and how can I depict that?’ was a fun thing to think about with letters. 
Lately I think less about illustration, and I’m trying to focus on writing workshops, but I don’t know how I will share that on Instagram or how I will share that. I’ve thought about writing a few essays, but I think that on Instagram, the only thing that those essays could become would be an infographic. So I’m starting to feel as though Instagram is crumbling, and I don’t really know where to put my work now because that’s kind of the only space.”
<br>
“Yeah. Well, I’m a big advocate for just making your own website and presenting it in a super fun way there. But yeah. Instagram is definitely limited with that kind of expression.
I’m excited to ask you this, what letter do you think would make a great friend and why?”
<br>
“Oh this one is really easy. I’m glad that you asked. I think I’ve felt this way for a really long time, and I don’t know if it’s ever going to change: a double story g. I think this is maybe the friendliest letter because it’s really complicated and bizarre and weird. It makes a lot of sense when it’s a serif. It works better when there’s some contrast going on.
The double story g does get made into things that aren’t serif, but I think when that happens, it’s even funnier. It really reminds me of a human body. It has some things that humans have. It has an ear, and I think that this is maybe called a neck or an arm. This is like the tail. It has funny little body parts. So that’s kind of my favorite letter. What’s yours?”

<p>
“That’s really nice. The first thing I saw, I kind of put it on a 3D plane where the circle at the bottom is a pond and the top is a sun, so it’s like a sunset.”
<br>
“Wow, that’s really beautiful.”
<br>
“I liked seeing that for a second. I’d have to think about mine more. I do think about the lowercase letter a a lot. It’s a dependable letter.”
<br>
“Yeah, definitely. I depend on that letter a lot too. Like a double story g, I think a double story a or even a single story a can hold the entire personality of a typeface. It’s something I depend on to sketch with. It’s also the first letter of the alphabet, so I think that’s why I go there first. 
Did you have a point in your life where you wanted to try making the letter a a little different in your handwriting?”
<br>
“Yeah, I would experiment. The constant question of, ‘do you want to be a round ‘a’ or swirly ‘a’ person?’”
<br>
“I don’t know.”
<br>
“It’s okay to change all the time. It depends on the day.” 
<br>
“Yeah. I wish I had more of a round a than a mean looking a, I think.”
I put the noodles into a big bowl, and Leah poured in the broth. We mixed them together with big Figma spoons.
<br>
“True. If you were a shape, what would you be, what colour, and why?”
<br>
“I think it would be a triangle. I would want to be a right angle triangle. I think a right angle triangle is really important to life, building, and society. I’d want to be helpful to society. 
For colour, I’ve always really loved red. I think it’s abrasive, aggressive, and powerful. I love that colour because it’s protective to me, to be perceived at first as aggressive or something. 
But then internally, when I was little I liked the colour yellow a lot. So ketchup and mustard. What would you be?”

<p>
“Perfect. Hmm... I have been really obsessed with Kiki and Bouba lately, and I’ve been feeling very Bouba.”
<br>
“I totally feel that I’m Kiki.”
<br>
“I feel that, good contrast. For colour, I’ll just put a dot of colour inside of it, because I forget how to do this.”
<br>
“Oh, now it’s a flower!”
<br>
“Yeah! I think I’m chartreuse.”
<br>
“That’s like the colour of a really beautiful Moss.”

              />
</div>

<p>
We decided to use our kiki and bouba as bowls. She held them as I served our hearty Figma noodle soup. 
<br>
“Yeah, and like algae. It’s like looking in a mirror... What do you think you might reincarnate into?”
<br>
“I hope and I think two different things. I hope I can reincarnate into something a little bit easier next life, like not a human. But maybe I’m so narrow-minded to even think that things beyond humans have it easier. Like, who knows that an ant doesn’t have it hard? They probably actually have a terrible life. But, something with less brain-power. Maybe something in the ocean that floats. Or that’s part of a larger mass of stuff where the group kind of does the work and you sort of just go with the movements. That sounds like a nice break between lifetimes.
Like I said, I feel like we’re living through some really extreme times. Who knows what the future holds? It seems like the future is going to be way harder, so I hope that I get a break. I hope we all get a break. So that’s what I hope for. 
What I think I’ll be reincarnated as is so corny. I had read a post on Tumblr a long time ago as a teenager and it stuck with me. It was this very reblogged thing, some person’s write-up of talking to God, or some fable that I saw drifting in the wind on my Tumblr feed about how your soul is everybody.
That in all of your past lives and future lives, you just cycle through every single person throughout all of time. That not only you are your neighbour or your best friend from first grade, but you’re also Hitler and Stalin. But you’re also… I’m trying to think of someone like, I’m really trying to think of a historical figure that was like, for sure super good.”
<br>
“Yeah, because you never know what they might’ve done.” 
<br>
“Well, so that’s the whole thing though. As good as you think you personally are, part of you is also the worst person that has ever existed, and every lifetime you get you have a new chance to be a lifeforce. So if I’m reincarnated, I think I’ll probably just be this infinite set of possibilities that is everybody else.”
<br>
“That’s a nice thing to look forward to. What are some things you do to maintain your lust for life and creativity?”
<br>
We navigated to our Figma Fridge to find something good to drink.
<br>
“When I was talking to the design club at UC Davis they asked, ‘How do you stay creative? How do you stay passionate? Blah blah.’And I told them that I try to do things that require my imagination to work, like reading fiction. As you read you envision who the characters are.  Reading is something I haven’t done for awhile, because I’ve given my attention to Tik-Tok, Instagram, and Twitter. Even scrolling through Are.na, which is more like health food to me. I’ve given away a lot of my attention during COVID to digital stuff, and have stopped reading.
But I think if I were to read again, things would be less hard. I also think that staying interested and learning can keep me creative, because if I have new interests, then there’s new reasons to have things to work through with whatever medium I’m into at the moment.
Also, staying in awe of other people, which I think is part of learning, just being in awe of something or someone.
As for my lust for life, I mean, I try to keep that going by having three meals a day. Getting excited about the little things in life, you know.  Recently I discovered with my partner – we had bought candy for Halloween, and it was the grossest bag of candy because everything was sold out. It was just Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops, and I was really pissed off about that bag of candy. I thought, ‘oh, there’s no Snickers in here. It’s not going to be good,’ but my partner and I discovered that the Tootsie Pops are incredibly delicious.
When you do get to the Tootsie Roll in the middle, eating that with the remnants of the lollipop left… there’s nothing better than that. So that’s how I stay hopeful for tomorrow, is that there’s a lollipop that I’m going to allow myself to have in the evening tomorrow too. How do you keep your lust for life and for you to be flowing?”
<br>
We found some lust for life in our Figma fridge to drink, and used Leah’s right angle triangles as cups.
<br>
“Well, I think the little rewards at the end of your task list of the day is really good. And you know, calling my grandparents.
That, and just being in nature and pretending I’m not me sometimes. Just being like, we’re all just another breathing thing... just staring into the void and being like, ‘It’s good. We’re just here.’”
<br>
“Yeah. I need to do that. I’m actually going to do that. Before I fall asleep tonight, I’m going to not look at my book or phone and just like stare into the void of my eyelids and be like, ‘my bed is so comfortable!’”
<br>
“Nice. It might be a little scary, but it’ll be good.”
<br>
We each took a taste and found that lust for life is quite refreshing. 
<br>
“I have a question for you actually, are you the type of person that will go take a walk if it’s raining out?”
<br>
“Depends where I am. Because here at my parents’ place, like I do have to drive somewhere to get somewhere interesting, you know, cause I just live in the suburbs, so it’s like, I’ll stay in my room. But when I was on vacation, it was a rain or shine kind of vibe, especially when you’re on vacation, you’re like, I’ll do anything, you know? What about you?”
<br>
“I feel like I have to say yes, because it’s always raining in Portland. And we deal with that. But I also have to say no, because I don’t like to not be warm. Yet being outside, in nature, is much more beautiful when it’s raining lightly or even raining really hard. So it’s worth it to go see, it’s just uncomfortable to be a human and see that. Maybe I need a better rain jacket.”
<br>
“Yeah, dressing for the weather is underrated. I think I’ll probably go out for a walk next time it rains.”
<br>
“Yeah. Try it out.”
<br>
“We were talking about social media earlier. What do you think of love in relation to communication over social media? If you had to put it on our diagram, where would it be?”
<br>
“I think I have my outer world. It does have to intersect with my heart sometimes, because I do choose to have social media. 
Ok, I have judgement  over here, and then social media is like perpendicular to my Heart, and over there in the corner is work.
I will say though, my Instagram close friend’s story and my Twitter are closer to my heart. I actually use it to talk to people that I would talk to if we were together in a room, but… I’m not in the room with them. So those are on the outer-line, they’re almost the same as my friends, but it’s not the same.”
<br>
“Yeah, there’s a buffer. I would say the same thing. Sometimes there are digital connections that can impact your real heart in a great way. If social media was an essence or a being, what would it be?”
<br>
“If it was its own icon or something? Here, let me find something that only Google images could give me. I feel like it would literally be this shape, and exact colouring.
That’s what social media looks like in my brain. If it were personified, it’d be something that makes you look.”
<br>
“It’s a really fun little shape, but it’s also grabbing your attention in a very intrusive way.”
<br>
“And if we didn’t know it was an arrow, maybe we would think it was a knife, or a machete. Something really dangerous.”
<br>
“It’s looking like the Pisces sign.”
<br>
“It’s a little scary.. no offence to any Pisces.”
<br>
“I love Pisces honestly. But yeah, I think that’s very accurate.”

<p>
We scrolled back over to our table.
<br>
“So, I’ve been thinking about being glamorous, and one of the adjectives I would use for the art you share is glamorous. So I wonder, what is your personal relationship with being glamorous?”
<br>
We decorated the table glamorously with a double story g and a theme. Our chairs and table were the letters: b n d.
<br>
“I love to be glamorous. I love glamour. I love to dress up. I hope that my interest will just grow stronger over time as my body is more and more incapable of holding any type of mainstream glamour. I think it’s maybe more glamorous to be an older person and wear a lot of makeup than it is to be a younger person and do the same, but both are beautiful and very glamorous. But I do have to say, I think it’s cooler looking when it’s someone who’s a bit older looking. I think in my work, even in my workshops, there’s still some type of glamour going on, because I think of it as performance art. I’m still kind of centering myself a bit for the first part, and then I do try to take myself away.”
<br>
We cut our noodles up with cursor forks and arrow knives.
<br>
“But I mean, I am an only child, an artist, and a creative person. In my head, my own reflection has been at the forefront of a lot of my personal experiences. I’ve spent a lot of time alone, especially when I was little.
So that egotism is interesting to me, and repulsive too. And I think like glamour is a little repulsive, because it’s about looking, but it’s not about looking for a long time usually. The longer you look at something glamorous, maybe the more weird it starts to look. And I love that. I think the grotesque part of glamour is really cool. 
I am trying to interest myself in minimalism right now, even though I’ve been really maximal in the past. I think maximalism performs better on social media. So I’ve leaned into that out of necessity in the beginning, but maybe now I can start to allow myself to do things that probably won’t perform very well on social media and be interested in that performance too—or lack of. 
I wonder how glamour will find its way into my middle of my interest in minimalism, or if my interest in glamour will go away for a little bit. In general I love it. I like it when people and things are over the top. I like decadence. 
When there’s decadence, some-one’s usually deprived or something. And I think that that dynamic is really interesting. It’s absolutely disgusting that there’s rich people and very impoverished people. But I think that that dynamic is pretty fascinating, even though it’s people, I think that evil stuff can be fascinating too.
But I think some people can get really fixated on evil things, like World War II buffs. I’m kinda like, maybe get another hobby. If that’s your hobby.”
<br>
“Yeah. Focus more on glamour.” 
<br>
“Like at least read tabloids too if you’re going to become that involved. Like, have some humour.”
<br>
We took our first bites of the meal and found it was missing something... but couldn’t place it. Nevertheless, it was delicious.
<br>
“I met someone on vacation, I was really inebriated while meeting them. I was at a resort with my mom—which is very glamorous—and everybody there was people who go to resorts. So they were very weird, interesting people to me. I’d never been to a resort before, it was my first time. 
So, I met this person and they asked me what I was reading. I said I wasn’t reading anything... and then they told me what they were reading. I think that’s what they wanted when they asked me the question. But they said that they always love to read stuff about World War II, or like historical fiction about that. I was like, ‘so like Nazis?’ and they’re like, ‘yeah, I really love to read stories about the Holocaust.’ and the fact that he was saying this to me as a stranger, like really disturbed me.
Like, whoa, you kind of asked me a question to tell me that. Which is a little crazy. So I really mean it when I say that if you are a World War II buff, get it together and focus on some other things too. Not to say that it’s bad to know about WWII—it’s good to know about it—but I have my opinions about leaning too far into that.”
<br>
“Oh yeah, that is deeply concerning. Thinking back, about minimalism, I feel like the more minimal glamour gets, the more it’s interpreted as elegance. So maybe it’ll come off more like that! I’m excited to find out.”
<br>
“I hope!”
<br>
“What are some little things that warm your heart?”
<br>
“I’m really just exposing who I am, as not any type of high artist or anything, but just as a person… 
I think it’s so incredible, and it brings me to tears sometimes, when I’m watching a talent show, like America’s Got Talent, and some small child is able to do something only an adult usually does. Like, singing an opera or doing a difficult choreography perfectly.
Or if they have this talent that seems so outside of their little tiny body—it moves me to fucking tears and I love it. Especially the opera stuff. I’ve gone down plenty of YouTube spirals where I’m no longer watching America’s Got Talent, and I’m watching like Italy’s Got Talent, because I can’t get enough of the opera singing children. It really warms my heart!”
<br>
I turned on some child opera music.
<br>
“I have also been really warmed by Winter/Fall stews. A great soup or stew is so delicious and satisfying. I love that, it’s my favourite type of meal.”
<br>
“Yeah, I couldn’t agree more with that too. I feel like everyone, at some point, needs to find their signature stew or soup. I hope one day I can have a signature soup.”
<br>
“I hope that for you too, and I think it’s coming.”
<br>
“Good, thank you. What is your favourite soup?”
<br>
“Chilli. Some people think chilli is its own thing. I could see that, but to me it seems like a stew.”
<br>
“I think so too. Finally, if the things you love were a shape, what would they be, what colour, and why? So that conglomeration of the opera kids and chilli, what is that being?”
<br>
“Oh yeah, let me look something up. There’s a lot on here to choose from. I had to take this one, but maybe it’s not just this one—it’s all of them. 
For one of them, I looked up clickbait arrow. And for the other, I looked up clickbait circle. I think it works better when you see it in use. Here’s something totally unrelated, where the clickbait circle is in use and is working with the arrow. 
I just love it when clickbait is circling something, and they make it really big and it creates this mystery for you in a little tile at the bottom of some news article. So I think that’s the shape of everything I love, it’s just something that I can’t believe I want to look at, but I love, love, love it, and can’t wait to click on it.”
<br>
“Cool, that’s very accurate. I love it. Well, I’ve truly enjoyed cooking with you today.”

Suddenly, we realized that what our noodles were missing was clickbait circle and arrow flakes! I got them from the Figma cabinet and we each mixed some in. Perfect!
<br>
“Yeah, it was really nice meeting and talking with you too. I enjoyed that. 
If there’s any loose ties, I just want to reiterate that I did use the word whore and I once again, am trying to use it outside of any negative cultural connotations it may hold, but I acknowledge those too. I believe it’s not a bad word. I think it’s a great, concise word for something. 
A second thing is I think I admitted that I have a cold heart, and I do want to say that there are moments in my life, that are like my shining memories that I have, where my little cold heart becomes so warm and overjoyed. So I promise that I’m not super evil or anything. And I mean, no offence to any of my friends for putting you on the third tier of my heart. I’m sorry, but that’s where you belong to me. It’s no big deal, it’s not an insult. It’s just me.”
<br>
“It’s probably where you belong to them as well, you know?”
<br>
“Yeah probably, and I’m fine with that. I like the third tier.”
<br>
“It’s a comfortable tier.”
<br>
“Yeah, it’s really nice.”
<br>
We savoured our delicious Figma noodle soup, then cleaned up our mess. Afterwards, with warm hearts, we wished each other a good night and went back to our homepages.
