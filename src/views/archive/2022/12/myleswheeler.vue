                TIANA — What's your day to day like?
    <br><br>
    <span class="myles">MYLES — I'm a freelance editor. That's what I do most, day-to-day. In between that, I've been working on my latest thing, Boy Ant, for a long time. Now that I've finished that, I'm trying to sort of remember what my usual routine is, because my routine for the past year has basically just been doing my usual video editing freelance stuff, and then writing the monologue Boy Ant thing. But now that's done. I feel I have more spare time now that it's done. So I'm trying to figure out, “Oh God, what do I do now? What do I fill this time with? What do I do?”
    </span>
    <br><br>
    After all that busyness, it's hard to accept that you can just do nothing first for a minute.
    <br><br>
    <span class="myles">Yeah. You make films yourself, you mentioned in your email.</span>
    <br><br>
    I just finished filming something and now I'm onto editing, so, yeah. 
    <br><br>
    <span class="myles">Do you have that feeling when you finish something, and sometimes it's a bit like, so much of my focus has been on this thing now, like, I dunno what I do now. I feel it's quite easy to move on too quickly as well. I'm trying to take a moment to celebrate that I finished something, rather than being like, ah, shit. Where I feel like a part of me just wants to like, make something else. I feel like I need to remind myself to like, you know, just enjoy the fact that you've finished something rather than just thinking, oh God, you need to be productive. Make something else. 
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. With the film I'm making now, my main goal with it was to write something that's fun to film, like focusing on the process. And so I think it's been a good practice for like, just letting it happen. So that's been cool. 
    Since you edit so much, I guess it's kind of ironic, because Boy Ant doesn't have a whole lot of editing. Is it one take or did I miss a couple cuts?
    <br><br>
<span class="myles">No, no. There's no sneaky secret cuts. It's all one take. When I first started, I thought my main strength was editing, so I was intrigued to see, could I make something if I took that away? Could I still tell the story? Because I feel like for better and for worse, sometimes I feel like, I guess, you know, when people say, ‘We'll fix it and post.’ — that sort of mindset, which I definitely rely on a bit too much. Like, sometimes I'll film something that I feel like is a complete mess and I don't feel I would be able to give it to another editor, because I feel like I've mucked it up when I've filmed it. But then I have to puzzle-workout what the hell I was actually trying to say. So for better and for worse, I think editing is a strength of mine — maybe I rely on it too much. I wanted to test whether I could tell a story with zero editing i n that main monolog thing.
    <br><br></span>
    How many takes did that take you?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I did six takes. So, I stayed at an Airbnb by the seasides for three days. I wanted to film at sunrise and get some nice sun. The take I went with was at 8:00 AM, so it's kind of sunrise-ish. But, I really liked the image of the sun backlighting over the course. My main intention going into it was that I wanted it to start a bit dark, and over the course of the hour it gets brighter. But it was too cloudy. Every single day I woke up at like 6:00 AM for the sunrise. It was like, “today there’s gotta be a bit of sun!” But it was so cloudy. So, I did six takes in total. And then, when I realised I was only getting it when it was so cloudy, I was like, I've just gotta film a take later in the day. I filmed one at sunset. I was like, I just need to get as many options as possible. Mm-hmm.  especially, cause I can't edit. I can't edit it. So I just need to get as many options as possible. So, I ended up doing six takes over the few days and then going with the one that I did.

              />
    <br><br>
    Yeah. And do you like filming in public? Is it ever nerve-wracking to like — is it just a one person show too?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah definitely, it is. Could be equal parts nerve-wracking and quite fun as well. Cause the reactions you get — I've been looking through some old footage, just playing around with some footage today. And one of the clips, I was filming on another beach — I love filming on the beaches. As I was filming some person, some random man just came up to me, and in the background of the footage you can hear him ask if I worked for the government. I can't tell if he was joking or if maybe he was a bit of a paranoid guy. But I think it was mainly because I had this big prop. I'd made a big metal detector out of a broom. So it probably looked a bit suspicious. This guy was like, are you working for the government? What is this? Or are you doing art? Is this art or government conspiracy? I didn't know whether I should play along. I didn't know if it was joking or if he was serious. I think it's quite fun though. Cause I think, you see a camera, I feel like that there's a lot of conversations with strangers. They feel more comfortable starting the conversation because it's like, “Oh, this is for something.” I feel like if you saw a random stranger just still on the beach, you wouldn't go up to them and go, “Oh, what are you doing?” Because they're just maybe in their own thoughts. Whereas, when I was filming, before and after a few of the takes, people came up to me and asked me what I was doing. There was a really nice lady who was walking her dog at one of the 6:00 AM takes and she asked me what I was doing, and I said what I was making a monologue about, and how I had a lot of personal connections with the beach that I was filming it on. And she's like, “Oh yeah, same. I've spent my whole life here just on this beach. So it's nice that you really like this beach.” It was a nice conversation. I don't think it would’ve really happened unless the camera was there as an excuse to be like, “Oh, I can talk to this person because they're talking to themselves, I guess.”
    <br><br></span>
    That's sweet. How much of Boy Ant was scripted versus just riffing? Like did you have more of an outline of points you wanted to hit or was it like you knew the words you wanted to say?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I'd say it's probably about 90% memorised, scripted. I spent like a week beforehand just literally just doing nothing else but just reading the script and writing it. There wasn't too much that I improvised, mainly because I was cautious of like — you could say something that's nice and in the moment and fun, but equally you could maybe halfway through a take say something stupid, or that doesn't make sense. So I stuck quite strictly to what I planned to say. Mainly just cuz there was a sort of time limit,  and it was so cloudy. So I was like, if it was sunny maybe I would have improvised — the sun was my favourite. It was a bit of a time issue. So I did stick about 90% to the script.
    <br><br></span>
    The performance felt really natural. Did you ever do any acting training? Or is it just like something you've picked up for yourself?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I've always liked drama and stuff. I haven't really done anything outside of just school. Really enjoyed, you know, doing the school shows and stuff. I think I first probably got into YouTube because I was really enjoying drama as a hobby. I sort of saw YouTube as like, I could just talk to a camera and it’s basically my own little stage. 13 year old Myles was excited for the prospect of like, “Oh, I could put my own little shows on in my bedroom!”
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Your YouTube goes all the way back to like 2010. Was there anything you recorded as a kid that was too bizarre to put on YouTube?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I mean, there is a video somewhere out there of me fully clothed in a bath. Just holding my breath underwater with a really stupid smile on my face. And that went straight up on the channel. So, I think if fully clothed looking weirdly happy in a bath — if that's going up, I dunno what would be too weird. There’s a video of me ironing a banana. I ironed a banana. Cause that's quite wacky when you're 13. That's quite funny. If you want to iron a banana. So yeah no, I don't think there's anything where it's like, “No, that's a bit too silly.”
    <br><br></span>
    Yeh, no limits.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I'm bathing in all my clothes and ironing bananas. So I think anything goes, yeah. 
    <br><br></span>
    That's really amazing. I feel like when I was a kid, I guess I felt more cautious about posting stuff, but maybe my parents were more cautious. They were like, “Don't put anything on the internet, or you're gonna die.”
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    For sure, yeah. I remember our hairdresser, when we were younger, was talking about Facebook and how dangerous it was.  And I bear in mind now that my parents love Facebook, my parents are all over it. And I remember at the time my mom, after my hairdresser left, was like, “Oh, you're not going on any of these sites.” I was like, “It's fine, Mom.” It's so interesting how now, I feel like parents especially are such big Facebook people, as I remember how about 10 years ago, it was such a scary place — I mean it still obviously can be a scary place — but it's interesting how the perception of speaking online has flipped. And from a parent's point of view, it’s become more of a safe place. I feel like young people are less on Facebook now.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Did they ever know, like in 2010, did your parents know you were posting stuff to YouTube?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I think so, yeah. And I think they were a bit apprehensive. Because I did have a YouTube channel before my current one. My current YouTube channel is called ItsaMeMyleo, the one before that was called ItsaMeaMyleo. So there was another one where I had two a’s. Which is already quite a tricky thing to pronounce. If someone doesn't get that it’s meant to be a Mario reference, it’s a bit like, what are these letters? So I'm kind of glad that [it only has one ‘a’ now]. I had that YouTube channel first, but my parents weren't, uh, best pleased. So I deleted that, and then a few months later I sneakily created another one.
    <br><br></span>
    Sneaky. Nice.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Rebellious, rebellious 13 year old. You’ve gotta create a youtube channel to rebel against your parents.
    <br><br></span>
    Are your parents creative people? Like how did you get into all these creative things like music and writing and filmmaking? Was it something you picked up yourself, or?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. I don't think my parents are not creative people. My mom does a lot of singing and stuff. I think when my dad was my age, he did a lot of theatre stuff — They were quite a creatively accepting household. They liked a lot of theatre stuff themselves, but I think it was probably — I know me and my brother, we both bonded over art and video games and stuff and growing up. So I think we both sort of just found another sort of home in the internet. We had, in the days of dial up internet, we used to save Sonic sprites, you know, like her pixel art. We used to like all these pixel art sonic websites where people showed you how to make your own sonic characters and pixel art. So in the days where we had dial up internet, it cost per minute or however long you spent, we always used to save all these websites offline. So then we could just study these sonic art websites. So I'd say, yeah, me and my brother have sort of mainly bonded over creative stuff growing up.
    <br><br></span>
    That's cool!
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Did you have dial up Internet when you were younger, or? I'm not sure how old you are, but I think we're the same age.
    <br><br></span>
    I don’t think so. I started using my parents' computer, maybe I was like nine or something and I got into it. There was this website I remember called stretchy faces and they'd just have pictures of celebrities, and you would just click around and drag their faces around. It was like the most entertaining thing in the world.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Did you ever go on the Impossible quiz? I remember that it was big over here.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. That was impossible. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, as the title would suggest. In our computer lessons in school, our teacher banned everyone from playing that because young 13 year old kids were obsessed with just stretching faces or doing impossible quizzes. 
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Feels much different now. We just needed one gimmick and we were set for the day. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Stretching some faces was fine. We'll, we'll be happy for hours. 
    <br><br></span>
    I'm happy. Speaking of your brother, did the Dubid Boys Association, is that right? Am I getting that right? The dba? Yes. Um, did they have a dogma? Like did you guys follow any principles or maybe unspoken principles?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I think the main sort of slogan was have fun and bring down the government. Probably the main two slogans. [My brother and I] used to spend a lot of time just underneath my bed, which is where the DBA was founded. My brother designed proper passes — I say proper passes…
    <br><br></span>
    Proper! 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    He designed passes and then, to get into the secret base under my bed, we had to slot them in like we were clocking into work. 
    <br><br></span>
    Right, right.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    And we couldn't get into the secret base unless we did that. 
    <br><br></span>
    Wow. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It was a very formal organisation.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Very secure. Very underground.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, exactly. You can't get in if you didn't have one of those passes. Also because it was a very small space, so you probably could be just tricky to fit.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, pretty tricky. If you had to write a dogma for yourself, your own set of principles now, what would be a couple things on there? What's your mantras right now?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I don't really know. Just get through the day. 
    <br><br></span>
    That's solid. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I probably have more of a mantra for the stuff I make, rather than me personally, I guess. Just keep an eye out. That sounds a bit paranoid… keep an eye out. Yeah, “Keep an eye out kid. The world's a dangerous place!” I mean like, stay observant. Try and notice things. In terms of the stuff I make, I guess I like to have pops of little observations of stuff I've noticed. Especially if I'm filming it, if I've collected b-roll over a long period of time, it's important for me to stay aware of the world around me and that anything can be important, however stupid or mundane it could appear upon initial watch. Anything can be important.
    <br><br></span>
    With all this footage that you get, a lot of the time you end up like braiding these ideas together. What draws you to doing those sorts of things?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I always used to like doing scrapbooks as a kid. Just overlaying loads of different images or cutouts, mainly from like Dr. Who magazines. I'd often make a lot of Dr. Who scrapbooks. The Dr. Who scrapbook I had, I'd have a whole page that was a whole series of Dr. Who pictures, but in one piece of paper, which I quite like. Yeah. It felt quite cool to be like, here’s this whole 10 hours of TV that I can look at this piece of paper and it sort of contains that whole experience in one scrapbook thing. Not that I think I was thinking of that when I was like 10 doing it like, “I'm containing the whole series and one piece of paper guys. I'm thinking outside the box!” but looking back, I think that thought process has carried along. When I'm trying to film lots of stuff out in the world and then when I'm editing it… I like stuff that's dense. Maybe I also have insecurity that people will turn away if there's not a lot of stuff happening. If there's no quick cuts or footage. But yeah, I'm a fan of stuff that's quite dense and maximalist.
    <br><br></span>
    Did it feel weird with Boy Ant then? Having it just be the one take.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It did feel weird. Basically the complete opposite of what I just said, but it's not, I guess it's still dense in terms of words. But you know, there's no b role to support my points. Usually I'd like to have a bit of fun with b-roll underneath what I'm saying. Or some music or, you know… I think it played more into the idea of like, I'm telling a vulnerable story. So I liked the idea of not having any music for an hour or any other images. I hoped it would draw people in gradually over the hour. My hope was that people would maybe clock that, “Hang on, it's not cutting away.” Or maybe if people have seen previous videos of mine, they might clock it. Quite a few people who've seen stuff of mine before have commented and were like, “It took me like 10 minutes to realise that there weren't any cuts, and I was like, what's happening?” Because I usually do a lot of jump cuts, you know, as all vloggers do. But yeah, I wanted to do something completely different and see if I could still do that.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. I think it fits the narrative really well, with the somberness of it. Just keeping it still in one take. Are there any one-take movies that you know that were kind of inspirational at all?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Not really in terms of movies, but a lot of theatre stuff. A lot of other monologues that I've seen on stage I really like. There's a play called Constellations, which is about a couple meeting over and over again throughout parallel universes. And it's just two people on stage throughout the whole thing. But every time the lights above them flash, it signifies a new universe. Basically just two characters playing hundreds and hundreds of different characters. I remember stumbling across that when I was in school and I didn't get to read it, but I just remember the opening line of that was like, “every time the lights flash and the universe starts”. I was like, as a stage direction that's so fucking cool. It came to London, where I live now. Last year. So I finally got to see it after being obsessed with the idea of this play for so long. So yeah, I think I was probably inspired by a lot of the theatre, one person shows, and stuff like that.
    <br><br></span>
    Would you ever do a live show of Boy Ant, or do you think you’ll keep it in film? 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I'm not sure. I've done a few open mics and I've done condensed versions of it. When I was writing it, I did a few open mics just to see if any of the jokes worked or if they didn't. I did one the other night as well. I hadn't done one in a while. So I did a little 10 minute condensed version at an open mic, which went well. In terms of doing the full version, I'm not sure. But Edinburgh Fringe, which is like a big arts festival in Scotland every year, next year I wanna go in person. Because Boy Ant’s playing online at the minute. I wanted to dip my toes into the waters of Edinburgh Fringe, and sort of learn a bit about it. But yeah, next year my plan is to hopefully take up a new show and do it in person.
    <br><br></span>
    That's cool. And with Boy Ant too, is it entirely true or is some of it fiction? I don't know the balance there.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. I mean, when it comes to making stuff, for a while I’ve battled with the idea of like, when you're filming life, how much of it should be true? Or what even is true if you're filming it. Cause I feel like as soon as you film something, it's not, you're not, you know, it becomes filmed life, not actually life. And I feel like as soon as I realised I could let go of the idea of like, as soon as I let go of the idea of trying to capture a hundred percent the truth of something and realised I would never be able to do that, I could then finally try and go after the feeling of the truth more than the actual facts. So yeah, I'm more interested in following an emotional timeline of something, rather than getting bogged down in what happened. Cause a lot of the time what happened isn't how it felt, I think. So in terms of Boy Ant, there's some anecdotes that did happen, but maybe not within that time period, but felt relevant to explore a certain feeling. I feel like some people could feel disappointed in hearing that maybe some bits didn't happen exactly how they were told. But in terms of the feeling that I was trying to explore, there's a lot of stuff that I feel like, why wouldn't it go there? Because it matches up perfectly with the feeling I was trying to work out. I dunno, I feel like I'm rambling, but I dunno if that makes sense.
    <br><br></span>
    No, that does. Yeah. Sounds like a really freeing philosophy to have when you're trying to make something that's based on personal experiences.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. You, you're never gonna be, I think in university, when I was studying a lot of like, uh, autobiographical filmmakers, that's when I first got obsessed with like, I didn't really realise autobiographical documentaries were a thing until university. I was like, oh shit, this is like the stuff I've been trying to do. But I didn't realise that it was a thing, and like called autobiographical filmmaking. I think I was getting annoyed with the idea that I couldn't a hundred percent capture how something felt. As soon as I was like, well you don't have to because you're never gonna capture it a hundred percent, because life is life and films are films, so yeah. As soon as you just try and stick to the truth of the feeling, then I think you can get closer to it. I dunno if you could say that abstract art is truthful, but it's like you look at it and you feel something. I feel like that's still true in an arty way.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Getting the feeling across, that's a hard job too. Especially when you're trying to communicate it to other people. With testing the script at open mics, was that a good way to confirm that the feeling was coming across? Like, how do you confirm that what you've just written makes sense to other people? Or do you just kind of hope.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    A lot of it's hoping, yeah. At the open mics, it's mainly just seeing if jokes transitioned into anecdotes that weren't maybe that funny, but like yeah, just to see if, I could feel that if people were still listening or whether it felt confusing. So it was mainly just to sort of say it out loud and to see if people responded, even if they weren't laughing, and if it felt like it made sense by saying it out loud.
    <br><br></span>
    You seem like quite a busy person with all these creative pursuits. Is there anything you haven't tried that you're interested in, but don’t have the time for?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I think honestly I would just like to focus more on making videos because — it's an interesting perception, like you said I seem like a busy person, because I feel like I'm not, and I want to be more productive. I think personally I spend too much time working on one thing over a too long a period of time. And I would prefer to, rather than spend more time on doing something I haven't tried yet, commit more to making stuff more regularly. I made a feature film, documentary, vlog thing called Like a Dog or a Boat, you tether it a few years ago. I spent two years working on that and then I've sort of spent another year and a half working on Boy Ant. I was like, damn, it's quite a lot of time. It adds up. And then we've only made two things and like, I'm proud of both those things, but I was like, I wonder, I'm intrigued to see how much more I can know myself if I maybe made shorter things more regularly. Because I think a lot of people say it's quality over quantity. Which is true, I guess. But I also feel like with quantity, you could learn. 
    It's more like a return of investment in terms of your personal progress — you can more quickly assess whether this thing's good, or was it what you wanted to say. How does it reflect if you're making bad, worse things, but every week. I feel like creatively you could actually learn more about yourself rather than sort of going into hiding for like two years. Rather than just focusing on something else, I guess I’d like to just commit more and be more consistent. 
    <br><br></span>
    Right. With filmmaking, sometimes I'll be making a project and maybe it's a more casual project and someone will ask what it's for, and I'm just like, I don't even know if I can answer that. Sometimes it feels like maybe people think there needs to be a huge purpose to what you're filming sometimes, but sometimes it's just like sketching. I feel like there's not a lot of space for filmmakers to just be sketching. Like, and I think that's so necessary for figuring out what you're even trying to film.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, in work if someone asks you what something’s for, it’s always going to launch into an existential crisis.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It's for me, I guess. I don't really know, yeah. Although, that is a great way of getting — if you're ever filming in public and someone asks what you're filming, in terms of like a security reason, like if the big, scary people are like, “What you're filming, you can't film around here,” cause they work for the private property you're filming on. I've always managed to get away with continuing filming by just saying it's for me. Sometimes they argue. they're like, “oh yeah, but is it gonna go on YouTube?” and I say, “I mean, it's not the main intention behind it, like maybe but at the minute it's just for me.” “Okay. But is it gonna go somewhere?” “No, it's just gonna stay on my laptop probably. It's for me.” “Alright. Okay. We'll carry on.” There's many times where I've just got out of getting in trouble by just saying it’s for me.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. I like that. That reminds me of — There's like this woman who talks a lot about like the law of attraction and how people will ask you what you're doing, and it's like just a good enough reason to be like, oh, it's just like for pleasure and to have fun. And they're like, okay, but like, what's your main goal? It's like, just having fun. Yeah. That's very freeing and it's totally enough of a reason to do anything. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Oh, yeah. Having fun is just as important as just whether it's for a film festival or for success, whatever. Having fun and just making it for the sake of making it, it's just as important.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, I'm into the law of attraction, all those cool things. Like do you have any philosophical things that you're drawn towards that help you in your life?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I don't really have any technical philosophies that have Wikipedia pages. I guess this is my philosophy actually: Coincidence. I'm not a particularly religious person, but if I had a God, I think it would be Coincidence. And seeing value in accidents. — Not seeing value in bad things, like a psychopath, no. — Accidents, like little moments. Connecting and finding coincidence through life is a way that I find meaning through a lot of videos I make. A lot of B roll that might match up. Because I think editing is a coincidence a lot of the time. A good cut, however much the directors intended. Something an editor can find, like a nice little bit where an actor's eye line maybe says something different, and it might not match up with the next shot, but you can find those coincidences and suddenly there's meaning between those two shots. I guess it goes back to just being open and being aware of the world, and anything can be important because any just coincidence or seemingly mundane, pointless thing could be useful and could tell you something about the world or something else. I like coincidence.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. Reading between the lines. — If you died today, what's something you haven't done yet that you'd be pissed that you missed the opportunity on?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I dunno, what's your answer? 
    <br><br></span>
    Oh man, well, I've been eager to travel across the ocean on my own and just see what happens. Like, just throw myself into the world because I mean, over COVID I got stuck living with my parents for a while, and now it's kind of over, not really, and I'm like, I guess I should get back into life.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. That's a good one. I dunno. 
    <br><br></span>
    That's good. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    No, but I dunno if it is though. 
    <br><br></span>
    Oh no. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Not having one, doesn't that also feel slightly directionless?
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, maybe. But then again, having no direction is kind of freeing. It's like the whole thing of like, “Nature [does not hurry], but everything is always [accomplished]” (Lao Tzu) kind of thing.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I guess I'd maybe just be annoyed that I haven't — it's going back to the consistency thing — been staying consistent with the things that I like doing.
    <br><br></span>
    That's fair. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Is that okay? Is that alright? 
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, that's good. It's hard to stick consistent with anything, and especially with creative things, you always feel like you need to wait till you're in that creative head space and stuff. Like, what do you think keeps you from consistency?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I think it's the classic bit of fear. The old fear. Overthinking it. And uh, I think part of the reason I often sink a lot of time into bigger projects like Boy Ant or Like a Dog or a Boat You Tether It,  is probably because things feel like they get out of my control. And then, both Boy Ant and my, uh, featured documentary vlog thing, Like a Dog or a Boat You Tether It — too long of a title to say in a casual sentence — they both started off as much smaller ideas, and then they just escalate. I often self doubt the idea. Like, “Well, there's not much meat there if it's just a small couple of minutes thing.” And then I feel like the more life passes, the more I wanna understand that life. And then it gets internalised into the video project. The more life happens, the more I wanna capture it and understand it in this current thing. Whereas really I should just break it down and like people do and make, you know, smaller things to process it as it happens. 
    <br><br></span>
    Or both!
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, I think there's probably a balance there. But yeah, I feel like otherwise, like two years goes by and I'm still mentally, well not mentally, but like creatively at least two years younger than I am. Because I've only just finished processing life from two years ago. And then I feel like I get struck with that sort of like, “okay, I'm playing catch up now creatively.” Yeah. What, what was the question again? 
    <br><br></span>
    I don't remember.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Went off on an existential bit of despair.
    <br><br></span>
    Oh yeah. The whole, “if you died today”. What do you hope happens when we die? Where do you expect to go and then afterlife, or maybe you expect to come back?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I expect to come back. I'll be back. Don't worry about it, I'll be back. There's obviously the very depressing, realistic answer — of nothing. But you read that in print and that's not that fun. Is it like, “Oh, don't wanna check out this guy's film!” I think actually what happens — this is it, this is the answer. —  So what happens is you sort of die, but it's just, it's quite nice. And then you wake up actually, and you're like, “Did I die?” And there's a rabbit that sort of reads you poems and uh, you can get on the rabbits back cause the rabbit's really big. And just go around sort of a white void. But for copyright reasons, it's not referred to as heaven. You sort of just run around and the rabbit tells you facts about things. And maybe gives you snacks. It puts snacks in your mouth and it feeds you. It doesn't let you feed. The rabbit puts food in. It sort of just goes on like that, I think, until maybe you go to sleep and then you wake up and it's a different animal. Like a badger or something that feeds you. Um, I think that's what happens actually. Yeah.
    <br><br></span>
    I think that's a solid inquiry. I think people should study that. I think that's good. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It's not the Easter Bunny, by the way. No. It's a different rabbit. 
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. It's mostly for copyright reasons, but also just the Easter Bunny doesn't have the right vibrations. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    And the Easter Bunny's still technically working. What do you think happens when, uh, we, uh, yeah.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, I think that's pretty close to what I was actually thinking, but.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Oh, nice. Cool.
    <br><br></span>
    But I think reincarnation would be really cool, but I don't know.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Oh yeah, that’d be very cool. I'll definitely be up for it.
    <br><br></span>
    So I'm kind of crossing my fingers for that.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I wouldn't say no. 
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. You filmed Boy Ant on that beach, you were saying that it was a sentimental place in your life. Are there any other places in nature where you had a really nice quiet moment that was maybe an inspiring moment? What other places have struck you?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    In Nara, Japan, where my brother lives, I went there a few years ago before the pandemic. It's a place where instead of the amount of pigeons that there are in London, which is a lot, they have deer. There's deer everywhere, as if they're just pigeons. My brother and I climbed up this big mountain thing. It wasn't quite a mountain. Hill, maybe. At the top you could see there were loads of deer, even at the top of this really big mountain. It was really, really lovely. Very, very calm. There was a couple getting their wedding photographs taken, and it was literally just them and the photographer, a load of deers, and nothing but grass and the view of Kyoto stretched out in front of us. It was very, very, very calm. My brother and I had some biscuits in our pocket, which you can feed the deer. They're like special deer biscuits. On the way back down, me and my brother saw two deers looking directly at us and we joked that it was us reincarnated as deers cuz there was one small one and one big one like me and my, my big bro. We gave them our last biscuits and then went on our way. So that was a very nice moment.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. That's nice. I think that is proof of reincarnation.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. And I did really in the moment — They did look very much like us, the way they were stood there — hungry for biscuits.
    <br><br></span>
    That sounds like a really awesome moment. Now I wanna go to Japan.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    What about you? You got a favourite nature place? 
    <br><br></span>
    I think so. I have some family, like fourth cousins, in Iceland. We used to go a little more often before COVID. There was one time we were staying at this bed and breakfast that was on the ocean and they kind of had a farm going too. They had some horses and a farm dog. Inside they also had these little toy beds with these stuffed rats in them. For some reason I liked that too. Like they were really setting the, the like
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Cuddly toys, or rats?
    <br><br></span>
    They were hardly cuddly too. It was mostly like, it was like a really nice little joke of like, there's rats in the apartment, but they're just like all snuggled up in this tiny bed.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    But were they real? Were they, were they previously alive?
    <br><br></span>
    No, no, no. Toys. I think I would be a little bit more put off if it was real, but Yeah. Yeah.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I was scared for a minute. That's terrifying if they were real stuffed rats. Stuffed toys are better.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. But then outside, on one end it was this cliff with a waterfall, and then when you look the other way, it's just the ocean. It felt like I was in a little peaceful orb instead of the rest of the world, you know?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    That sounds great.
    <br><br></span>
    What artists do you like to copy, if any? Like what artists do you find a lot of inspiration from?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I get a lot of inspiration from a lot of other artists — not necessarily filmmakers. There's a lot of comedians that I really, really get inspired by, like — I’m so bad at remembering things about myself. — Two of my favourite poets are called Billy Collins and Caroline Bird. They both do very conversational poems, but often have one surreal element in it, but it's explored in a very normal way. Or a very normal thing explored in a very surreal way, often with a lot of humour. So I really like those two big inspirations. And then there’s these comedian siblings, called Jamie Demetriou and Natasha Dimitri. They’ve got a TV show over in England called Stath Lets Flats. I'm not sure if that's reached Canada yet. It's really good. They use language in a really funny way. They have a way of just making everything, every sentence, funny. Not because they're necessarily telling a joke, but just because of the way that they might put intonation changes on certain words that you weren't expecting, or they get an idiom wrong. I really like those two. 
    <br><br></span>
    That sounds cool. With the previous artist you mentioned, like this conversational and normal way of presenting writing and dialogue. Your films feel very handmade as well. What draws you to the kind of everyday mode of making things?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, I really like stuff that's very conversational. I feel like poetry in real life is often accidental stuff that we glimpse at the corner of our eye, just like another way light falls and we look at it and go, oh, that's really lovely. Whereas I feel like I'm less a fan of certain types of poetry that can feel quite rehearsed or their intentions quite obvious. I quite like art that feels like it's just fallen out of you, and you can do what you want with it rather than being very aware of what it's trying to say. I quite like stuff that's very conversational, because it tries to capture what poetry in the wild feels like, which is just sort of accidentally just noticing things.
    <br><br></span>
    That's cool. Do you have a top three favourite films right now? I know that's a taboo question.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. Favourites is tricky, isn't it? For a long time I've had two favourite films, but I've never been able to add a third one. I've never managed to get a third favourite, I think because the two favourite films really changed my life. I've put it on quite a pedestal. So, there's so many other obviously really great films that I really love and connect with. But the two films that are my favourite, I feel like really bookmark certain parts of my life really well. And that’s a film called Synecdoche, New York, directed by Charlie Kaufman; and Once, written and directed by John Carney, which is a musical. They're both very, very different. Have you seen either of those?
    <br><br></span>
    I've seen the… I can never pronounce the first word, New York.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Synecdoche. 
    <br><br></span>
    Yes, that one. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    What did you think of it?
    <br><br></span>
    It was a while ago, but I liked how it was a bit bizarre.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It's a weird film.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. I like a weird film. Isn't it one of those films that kind of creates a little universe bubble and that's where its bizarreness is? Am I remembering it right?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah, it definitely is. It's got a lot of surreal elements in it. It walks the line between being very normal and being very surreal. There's a scene where a lady is showing someone around her house and it's on fire, and it's not addressed in any way. Which I really like.
    <br><br></span>
    I love that. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    It's about a guy who gets given a grant to write a play and then the more life passes, the more the play gets out of hand. So it starts off just being about how he wants to make a play in about a year, and then it's in about a decade, and then he realises he spent 50 years working on his play and his family have left him. I think I either saw it at a really good time in my life or the worst time in my life. I saw it when I was like 18 I think, right before going off to university. It was quite a scary portrayal of creativity. Where it can take you if you’re indecisive. But I love that film, it's really beautiful. Very weirdly. It feels quite romantic even though it's quite like, um, Disturbing. There are some really nice moments between characters, but they can't really tell if they're connecting with each other because they're playing roles in this big play, or whether it's actually them as real people, which I really like.
    <br>
    But on the complete opposite of that, Once is a musical, really low-fi. One of those films that people talk about because it's like, “Oh yeah, it only costs like a couple of thousand pounds and it went like so much money.” It's literally just a lot of guerilla style filmmaking. They didn't really have permission, so they just shot on High Street. It's about a busker who strikes up a friendship slash maybe relationship with a lady who stops to listen to it on the street. And she's also a really talented musician, so they form a band and work on music together. It's kind of the complete opposite of Synecdoche. I feel like, creative wise, I can see myself in both those films. Because I wanna be somewhere in the middle, right? One that’s got too complicated and it ruins your whole life, because it takes hundreds and hundreds of years to make something. And the other one is really simple. It's shot with a cheap basic camera, but it's still really beautiful and simple. When I went into Once, I didn't know anything about it. Just judging from the title, I didn’t think I'd like it — I watched it when I was like 18 — I think I was a bit edgy with my opinion being like, “It's gonna be some boring romantic film.” And then I was crying throughout the whole thing. I think it's nice to have those moments where you have been a bit judgemental, just so you can remind yourself later when you feel that again to be like, “No, this could change your life like it did for that first time.”
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, I feel like 18 is such an important age to watch every psychological movie ever. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I really recommend Once though.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. I wanna watch that. 
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Yeah. It's very feel good. And the music's really catchy. What are your two favourites? Or three if you have a third.
    <br><br></span>
    Oh gosh. I need to re-watch them, honestly. I'm not good at remembering plots, but you know, you remember the feeling. One that impacted me, but it's not necessarily a good film, but it might be, is Kill Your Darlings. It was one of the first movies after Harry Potter that I saw Daniel Radcliffe in.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    His hair looks great in that. I remember everyone being like, “His hair looks more like Harry Potter in this film after Harry Potter than it ever did in Harry Potter.” — But I haven’t seen that.
    <br><br></span>
    It was about these university students kind of breaking the mould, and it was right before I was about to go to university and I was like, let's do this thing. And then there's A Pigeon Sat On A Branch… the elephant in the room vibe, but nobody addresses it. I like that. 
     <br><br><span class="myles">
    I've got You, the Living on my shelf. Another film directed by that guy (Roy Andersson).
    <br><br></span>
    What instruments do you play and do you have any memories from your childhood about how music became important to you?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I play guitar. I remember I got my first guitar for Christmas a long time ago. I took it around my Nan and Grandad's house to show them, and I tripped up the stairs and fell flat with the guitar. I was scared it had broken, but luckily it just was just very out of tune. That was the first outing with my guitar. Proudly. Guitar is probably the creative thing that I've spent the least amount of time on. Sometimes it's the thing that I have the most fun doing. Because it's the thing I've least considered. I've never had aspirations of really making it a job or making money from it or whatever. I'm rarely conflicted when recording music. If it's nothing but a hobby and a nice way to spend some time. When I'm making something, as much as I love having a finished film, it can often be quite a stressful or annoying experience. I'm sure you know when you're making something, when it's slightly chasing something, but you're not sure if you're quite there yet. Whereas with music, I don't really ever have that care or concern. It's nice to have another creative thing underneath video making. I rarely sort of stress about it. It's just sort of freeing like a hobby and creative stuff should be, I guess.
    <br><br></span>
    I have the same experience with music in that way. And with a film, you gotta write and organise everything… there’s so many different steps. But it's nice that you can just kind of punch out a song in one night, you get to write and then you get to yell your words and it feels good.
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    Exactly, yeah. It feels so nice when you're just playing loudly and stuff as well.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah. And with writing, I just found your poetry on your Instagram. I was mostly watching your YouTube before, but I just found all this poetry that I get to read, so that's cool. Would you ever publish a book?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I think so, yeah. It's interesting you mentioned that about poetry. Because I feel like in the last few years, similar to music, it's something that I've always sort of enjoyed, but it's only in the last few years that I've started doing more of it. Whereas I think if someone just watches my YouTube videos now and again, I don't think they would see my latest inspiration from poetry. Which is why I think with Boy Ant, you can kind of see a crossroads between my interest in poetry and the video making side of it. I've always enjoyed writing and trying the odd bit of poetry that you've thrown in now and again, even if it's not what you think a poem would be like. I've never actually read a poem straight in a video, but you know, I'll throw out an old poetic line here and there. I went into making Boy Ant being like, what if I was more sincere with my poetic aspirations and allowed myself one sincere moment. Well, not one sincere moment, because I think the whole thing has a sincerity to it. But at a moment where I would allow myself to have a bit of poetry, but I intentionally didn't feel self-conscious of saying that there's a bit of poetry in it. Because there's a few bits here and there where you could say it sounds a bit poetic, but it's maybe delivered with a joke that undercuts it or whatever. But there's a bit near the end where I talk about silence and different types of silence and stuff. I list off different types of silence. I was conflicted whether it sounded a bit too spoken wordy or a bit too rehearsed, but I sort of allowed myself — I think because I was sticking to wanting it to feel natural and conversational, but I allowed myself to have one bit of thing in it that felt more obviously poetic than the other bits that I maybe tried to disguise as off the top of the hedge conversation.
    <br><br></span>
    Yeah, I think that part was really nice for the pacing. The different kinds of silences hit home. Finally, any recommendations for our listeners and readers, anything you want the world to know about?
    <br><br><span class="myles">
    I just finished reading a book by a comedian called Katie Wix, who's quite popular in the UK, and I hope around the world because she's really good. It's quite a life-changing book called Delicacy: A Memoir about Cake and Death, about her relationship with parents who aren't well, and with body image. There's so many bits where she weaves so many lovely poetic bits into it and it never really feels forced. It just feels so natural and it fits so well with the autobiographical factual stuff that she's listing about her life. It's so nicely tied together.
    <br>
    It's got quite a nice surreal element to it. Like each chapter is a cake, because she talks a lot about her relationship with food. So each chapter — it feels a bit Charlie Kaufman — because throughout her whole life, these cakes are always spotted in the corner of her eye. So these big life moments are bullet pointed by different types of cake. I do recommend, it's a bit of a heavy book so maybe make sure you’re in a good head space for it. I really loved everything about that book.
    <br><br></span>
    I like when people compartmentalise their life and come up with chapters for it and stuff. That's so cool. What’s your favourite song recently?

    I've been revisiting Francis and the Lights. He's got a song called Like a Dream, which is really cool. The music video is really simple. It's just him dancing in a field over one take. The dance is so addictive as well. He's just sort of hopping but moving forward in a straight line. I’ve been listening to a lot of Biffy Clyro, a Scottish rock band. That's about it really.
