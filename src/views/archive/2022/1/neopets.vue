            <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              This year, NFTs seem to have exploded into unprecedented levels of
              cultural awareness. Art, music, gifs, and pixels can be purchased
              and owned on a crypto-backed platform. In some cases, NFTs are
              like rare trading cards, which have a set number of unique copies
              of the same artwork, each identifiable by a different code, called
              a hash. The allure of digital ownership can be mystifying: why
              would someone shell out cold hard cash for an image that can be
              screenshotted or saved? It was a question that had me scratching
              my head until I read this message in the Neopets Discord: </p>

            <div class="imgBox"><img src="./hp_0.jpg" /></div>

              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Much like NFTs, and perhaps a little like cryptocurrency itself,
              Neopets pet trading is a speculative game. Changes in policy mean
              perceived value can rise and crash in an instant. Neopets, though,
              is 22 years old, practically ancient in terms of web standards.
              It’s a relic of the Web 2.0 before the blockchain, social media,
              and the algorithm as we know it today. What did people come on the
              internet for? A cursory look into the Neopets site will uncover
              feeding digital pets, training their stats in the battledome, and
              dressing them up. But what gives the website its staying power is
              also true of what gives social media, and supposedly, NFTs, its
              hype: community. </p>
            
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Neopets, the community gathers on the
              NeoBoards. They are discussion boards where like-minded users can
              talk about the many aspects of the site - whether that’s roleplay,
              battling, or pet trading. Indeed, Web 2.0 operated this way.
              People sought others on the basis of specialized interests. Today,
              the algorithm plays a heavy hand in bringing people together
              through content, so it’s easy to forget that people are capable of
              finding one another just fine on their own. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Like all platforms which have faced pressure to adapt to changing times, Neopets is
              no stranger to metamorphosis. In 2007, The Neopets Team (TNT for
              short) began sitewide changes to how users could interact with
              their digital pets. These changes continue to affect a lucrative
              black market economy, a rich language of trading, and a
              speculative crash. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              To engage in the Neopets community, you need a
              pet. You can either create a pet - which comes in four basic
              colours, blue, red, yellow, and green - or you can adopt pets from
              the pound. Pounded pets can come in all colours, including pets
              which are painted from rare in-game paintbrush items. The pets in
              the pound are abandoned by people who don’t want them anymore, and
              anyone is free to adopt pets in the pound. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              One of the major site
              features introduced in this time was the ‘transfer’ option in the
              pound. It ensured a secure peer-to-peer transfer of one pet for
              another on different accounts. Transfers are limited by account
              age - the older your account, the more transfers you’re allowed
              every month. If you wanted to move one pet from one account to
              another before the change, it was through a risky pound manoeuvre:
              the sender would tell the recipient what time their pet would be
              abandoned, and the recipient would just have to refresh like crazy
              when that time came and hope they were faster than whoever else
              could snap them up. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              NST is Neopian Standard Time, which is what
              site dailies use to reset. The introduction of the transfer
              feature meant users could now engage in regular, guaranteed pet
              trading. A lively community of pet trading enthusiasts quickly
              started to form on the Neopian Pound board, colloquially known as
              the Pound Chat, or PC. Instead of grinding out games for NeoPoints
              to buy an expensive paintbrush, why not just trade one of your
              pets for someone else who wants your pet?</p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              The community-run system
              of how this informal marketplace operates has developed an
              incredible sophistication. While TNT places policy restrictions on
              what you can and can’t do - one pet may be traded for one other
              pet only, no buying pets, no offering rare items or NeoPoints
              alongside a pet trade - values of pets are almost completely
              determined by the community. Different types of pets have
              different values. Users will selectively make trades which
              discriminate between deciding factors your pet possesses: name,
              age, species, paint job, and perhaps most importantly of all,
              conversion status. </p>

              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              In the changes TNT implemented, their answer to
              one of the most requested features at the time - being able to
              dress up your pets - was a sitewide conversion to Adobe Flash,
              where previously dynamic pet artwork was made into standardized
              and customizable poses across 54 Neopet species. Pets used to be
              JPEGs drawn in different poses. It would be unnecessarily
              laborious to redraw an item of clothing hundreds of times to fit
              every combination of colour and species. TNT automatically
              converted most of the artwork to fit the new standardized poses,
              but they gave 227 combinations of pet colours the option to retain
              their old artwork. These pets with old artwork are called
              unconverted pets. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              It was a decision that made sense. Standardizing
              poses meant new wearable items could be coded into zones in Adobe
              Flash. Items could be layered according to what visually made
              sense. A background goes behind a hat, which goes over makeup. It
              also means custom tweaking for how different types of pets wear
              items is much less of a hassle, as body shapes are consistent.</p>

              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Obviously, TNT made a smart financial decision. The most coveted
              wearables can only be purchased through the NeoCash mall, which is
              the microtransaction hub on the site. Purchases of NeoCash keep
              Neopets afloat. People will readily drop up to thousands of
              dollars on buyables to customize their pets. It remains separate
              from the in-game currency, NeoPoints, which cannot be legitimately
              purchased, only earned by participating in site features. Think of
              NeoCash as currency used to purchase cosmetic modifiers, like
              skins in a game.</p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              What NeoCash and NeoPoints can’t buy is the
              pre-conversion artwork. These unconverted pets cannot wear
              clothes. Unconverted pets (UC for short) are highly coveted among
              Neopians, particularly Pound Chatters. UC pets find their values
              squeezing higher and higher due to their dwindling numbers;
              accounts are frozen, deleted, or just abandoned. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              People on the PC with an UC pet are treated with more respect. They are flaunted as
              a status symbol due to their grandfathered status - you cannot
              create an UC pet, you must either already have one, adopt one, or
              trade for one. If you paint an UC pet, it will convert to the new
              art. Users hand-code project pages for their UC trading goals,
              where ideal customizations, character stories, and artwork are
              fleshed out in HTML and CSS. Hundreds of applications flood in for
              the rare UC up for adoption, with applicants spending dozens of
              hours creating custom HTML/CSS applications in a bid for an UC
              dreamie.</p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              To navigate the tricky waters of the UC trading on the PC
              board, community-assigned pet values based on desirability and
              popularity are formalized in “tiers”. This information is hosted
              on custom petpages built with HTML and CSS by the community. Tier
              1 pets are relatively common and unloved, while Tier 10 pets are
              the most difficult to trade for, due to scarcity and popularity.</p>

              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              It’s not just a pet’s species and colour that matters, though. A
              pet’s name can have a huge influence on how it trades. Every pet
              on Neopets must have a unique name, just like how each NFT has a
              unique hash. What’s different in Neopets’ case is that the hash
              itself, the pet’s name, is itself a consideration in value.
              Typically, short and pronounceable names trade well, while pets
              with unpronounceable names with numbers and underscores are more
              difficult to trade. For example, ‘Afadu’ the UC royalgirl lupe
              will trade better than ‘Daisy12036’ the UC royalgirl lupe, even
              though they both have the same artwork. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              In the PC, these values
              are navigated using abbreviations. VWN (very well named), WN (well
              named), DN (decently named), BN (badly named), and VBN (very badly
              named). There are also RWs (real words) and RNs (real names). RWs
              and RNs tend to be outliers. A word like “Decommissioned” won’t
              trade for a high-value pet, but a name like “Flora” or a word like
              “Pluto” are considered highly valuable due to character potential,
              and regularly trade for even the highest tier UCs. Common RWs and
              RNs are rare because only one pet can have one name at a time,
              much like how only one person can own a unique NFT at a time.</p> 
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              UCs may as well be unobtanium for many. Like NFTs, there were only
              ever a limited number of UCs in existence. Their value gets pushed
              higher based on speculative investment. The demand for them is
              ridiculously high, 1700s Dutch tulip mania level high, yet there
              are extraordinarily few ways to legitimately obtain them. These
              factors create a perfect environment for a black market to thrive.
              Black market sellers hack into inactive accounts and loot pets,
              items, and neopoints in exchange for real-life currency. UCs will
              sell anywhere from $20 to $500 on the black market depending on
              the rarity of the pet, and the pronounceability of the name.</p>

              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              People will shell out hundreds of dollars for pet artwork anybody
              could easily right-click save. Neopets fansites such as JellyNeo
              and SunnyNeo host all the images of unconverted pets on their
              website. But what players are paying for isn’t just the artwork
              itself. UC pets are like a badge of honour players pin to their
              user lookup. When somebody clicks on a profile, pets are one of
              the first things people look out for. In essence, the prestige of
              a UC pet matters just as much to some, if not more, as the pet
              itself. Tier 10 UC ownership is the Hermès Birkin of Neopets.
              After all, anyone can save Nyan Cat, but someone paid the
              equivalent of $587,000 for the clout of owning it.</p> 
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              In the 14 years
              since conversion, an option to create UCs remains one of the most
              highly requested features on the site. Many veteran players of
              Neopets will tell you TNT is sitting on a gold mine they’re not
              taking advantage of. Users readily spend hundreds on NeoCash, and
              the demand for unconverted pets couldn’t be higher. Some of the
              most dedicated active players have been at it for over 10, 15, 20
              years. These are fully-grown adults with disposable income,
              practically begging to throw money at Neopets for an unconversion
              feature.</p> 
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Introducing an unconversion option immediately squashes
              the UC black market, which continues to create gigantic headaches
              for both TNT and the pet trading community. Some people log in to
              their old accounts, find their UCs have been stolen and traded
              away, and TNT has to reverse upwards of hundreds of pet trading
              chains, affecting dozens of members of the already small
              community. TNT’s years-long position was philosophically against
              UCs. TNT claimed it was impossible or just too difficult to
              unconvert pets, and shot down numerous requests over the years to
              reintroduce UCs to the website. As former TNT staff member Snarkie
              put it, “we always felt it was pretty dang unfair to take
              something away from everyone and then sell back access to it”.
              There are also technical concerns, such as the layers-based
              customisation feature outlined in Neopian Times Editorial 731.</p> 
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              In the past few months, this claim has been proven patently false.
              Leaked mails from a user who lost a pet due to a glitched trade
              reversal prove TNT always had the ability to unconvert pets at
              will. When this leak broke, the Neopian equivalent of hell
              breaking loose ran through the PC. It culminated in TNT making an
              official statement: they are bringing back UCs in 2021! </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              The PC is
              a market highly sensitive to policy changes and feature
              implementation from the centralized Neopets team. Although NFTs
              technically exist on decentralized platforms, the value of
              cryptocurrency is highly subject to legal policy, as well. The
              volatility of these markets means policy is scrambling to keep up
              in the wake of the massive environmental cost of minting an NFT
              onto the blockchain.</p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              Nobody except TNT knows how UCs will be
              brought back, and if there will be any specific requirements which
              will affect the nature of trading. It’s a foggy road ahead, but
              news has already affected the way PCers trade. Users are now
              trading their higher-tier UCs for converted pets with good names -
              RWs, RNs, and 4-letter or shorter names. The PC is anticipating a
              UC value crash, and holding out for the possibility that UCs can
              be made from well-named pets. There’s intense speculation
              surrounding what the conditions for creating new UCs will be. </p>
              
              <p style="text-indent: 15px">
              So why, after 22 years, are people still on Neopets.com? As many
              users on the /r/neopets subreddit or neopets discord channel will
              tell you, nostalgia. Neopets reminds us of a simpler time, a
              simpler us, a simpler internet that wasn’t out to transact every
              corner of existence. Neopets was born out of a passion project two
              college students developed and worked into being - not as a
              startup idea or incubator project, but just because. A website
              which asks for your participation in the community, encouraged by
              incentivizing daily ritual, is a foundational draw in that
              nostalgia factor. In an internet which is so tied up in capital,
              an aging petsite has never looked more compelling.
