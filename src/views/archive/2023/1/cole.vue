                    This piece was conceived entirely with a flip phone camera, and I composed the music for piano in real time with the video. It is about living and moving through the city. It is a contemplation on the spatial, volumetric relationships between the camera
                    and reality around it; an inquiry into the nature of perspective itself. As much as it is a contemplation on the objects and spaces the camera inhabits, the piece treats the image itself as a tangible object, as something to be kept and
                    held onto, as something that gets abused too often in the age of Instagram, TikTok, etc... This piece is a further expression of an established through line in my work, which I refer to as 'compressionism': the idea that digital imaging
                    technology, in its inadequacies and errors, can sometimes offer us impressions of reality that bring us closer to beauty and truth than images of high fidelity.

                <h3>TERRY COLE</h3>
                <p>
                    tcoopercole{@}gmail.com
                    <br> An American artist who works in painting, drawing, and photography. He was a child who came of age in a gap where digital technology was fully ubiquitous, yet prior to the dawn of social media. His work both leverages and inquires
                    into the implicit languages that images take on in the digital era, and which continue to evolve at exceeding rates. A through line in his work is a continued interest in the way cameras impose the perspective grid onto reality; the way
                    that the difference in sizes of image sensors relate to spaces and objects. Some of his works are made with flip phones, iPhones, and others made with large format digital cameras and scanners. There is a sense of both camera and subject
                    intertwining and harmonizing through his photographs. His work struggles to express substance and light to a world where the image is continually degraded and used by algorithms to make us more wanting and complacent. Cole's images leave
                    behind an artifact of youth in the age of the internet, full of yearning for wholeness and lament for an overstimulated, instagram-addicted generation.

                    <strong>Why were you inspired to make this specific film?</strong>
                    <br /><br /> I wanted to center things in the small approachable viewfinder of my Alcatel AT&T flip phone. I got it off of facebook marketplace to quit instagram and quit my addiction to my iPhone. This film is very tied to the object
                    of this phone and the way I felt like I induced forms of asceticism that led me away from digital technology. This specific film has a love letter to Boston inside it. It has unfamiliarity but soft light tenderness and kindness and breathing.
                    It has rich yellow light from the sun during cold months. <br /><br />
                    <strong>What do you like most about your film?</strong>
                    <br /><br /> I like the architecture of this film. The way transitions happen, the way camera movements suggest an awkward and unsolved orientation, a seeking, walking around a cube like you'd walk around a vehicle in a used car lot to
                    assess it. This film does a lot of ambiguous assessing and it does some keeping and some holding. <br /><br />
                    <strong>Did anyone specific become critical to the creation of your film?
                    Why do they stand out as significant to your film?</strong
                  >
                  <br /><br />
                  My girlfriend Ivy was really central to the editing process. I
                  probably showed her 2 or 3 cuts and the final thing changed a lot from
                  what I was originally going after. I think she helped push me to
                  sculpt this into something more specified and sanded down like a piece
                  of wood.
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong
                    >What is one of your fondest memories from the production/process of
                    making this film?</strong
                  >
                  <br /><br />
                  My fondest memories are when the camera kept calling me back; the
                  memory of making images that did not end up in the film but held up
                  the thick concept and looming cloud of making this project over
                  months. There are fond memories of the way I continued to work out and
                  define what I was trying to do with how I treated the little webcam in
                  my pocket. There are bits of life and moving through the city and
                  there are bits of confusion and anonymity.
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong>How does your true self shine through in your film?</strong>
                    <br /><br /> This film shows me trying to hold onto things that I lived through but which do not identify my life all that well. This film has a lot of what I see in it. This film has a lot of things I might feel a little ashamed to have
                    taken so much joy in seeing.
