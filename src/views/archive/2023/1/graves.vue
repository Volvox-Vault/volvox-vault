        <p>
          A few things recently happened that were the culmination of a lifetime
          of pain. To begin to understand, accept, and deal with everything—to
          move on with my life—I wrote a timeline of my entire existence. It
          contained my deepest Core (my soul, my Being, my consciousness, my
          unconsciousness, my me-ness). It was my deepest self, my deepest Me,
          full of my nethermost fears, anxieties, doubts, and insecurities. It
          was my soul laid bare. A new beginning. My childhood and adolescent
          years had long-lasting consequences on my perception of self. Yet, I
          never spoke about my childhood, not even with the people closest to
          me. I was embarrassed and ashamed. Instead, I expressed myself through
          art (as cliché as this sentence sounds). My art—chronicling
          billionaires, politicians, the porn industry, the invisible power
          structures behind photography etc.—is me detesting people who believe
          they have power. People who abuse other people for their own
          self-gratification. Beings who crave power and crush other beings to
          feel big. People who demand respect but do nothing to earn the respect
          they command. Men who feel the urge to make women and children feel
          vulnerable and small. This was my childhood. Yet, instead of facing
          it, I ran, I hid, I felt alone, frightened, rejected, and unloved.
          This project is an attempt to be me. It is me refusing to hide. It is
          a self-reflective metaphysical question that I couldn’t answer until
          recently—what does it feel like ‘to exist’? It is an attempt to yell
          at the top of my fucking lungs that I exist—that ‘I am’. Nonetheless,
          I never want to be defined by my perceived weakness—my abuse, my
          post-traumatic stress, my angst, and my depression. My childhood made
          me the person I am today, so I wouldn’t change the past, even if I
          could. I exist.

        <h3>KAILUM GRAVES</h3>
        <p>
          mrkailumgraves{@}gmail.com
          <br />
          Kailum is critically obsessed with the Web and born-digital content.
          He is particularly interested in image-rich technologies and the way
          global media communication—a landscape controlled by a handful of
          multidimensional oligopolistic corporate-run networks—can be sampled,
          organised, and considered in new philosophical, sociological, and
          political terms. Nonetheless, while these issues are political and
          economic in nature, Kailum believes anti-capitalist art offers no real
          alternative to the economic and ideological discourses of
          multinational capitalism. In its place, he is interested in examining
          the politics of the image and the construction of truth. To do this,
          he uses the Internet, which has normalised the act of collecting and
          compiling information, to preserve and curate found images and raw
          material. The aim is to engage with the cultural space and aesthetics
          of the Internet—and the vast amount of digital information it
          contains—as a subject, material, and tool of artistic production.
          <br /><br />
          To do this, Kailum investigates different media and photographic
          methods—from appropriation to pixel and data manipulation—to create
          still and moving image projects that reflect the influence of
          technology on the photographic medium and sit resolutely within the
          context of future movements of contemporary photography. One of the
          most convincing aspects of his approach is the way he urges the viewer
          to evolve from a condition of mere spectatorship to a position where
          they must actively reflect on the various roles of technology in our
          media-driven age. However, rather than openly expressing
          socio-political criticism, Kailum takes a gentler
          ‘hint-at-the-direction’ path which invites the viewer to a process of
          reflection. On the surface his work might seem easy to read, but on
          closer inspection a viewer will find that he draws upon a myriad of
          artistic, philosophical, scientific, theoretical, and
          cross-disciplinary approaches to achieve his highly refined poetic
          ends. <br /><br />
          Kailum’s research delicately exists in a space between photography,
          Internet art, algorithmic art, and digital performance. He uses a
          laptop the same way a photographer uses a camera to document, record,
          and manipulate the world—which for Kailum is born-digital artefacts—to
          explore the disappearance of clear boundaries between culture,
          environment, and technology. He is particularly interested in the way
          humans use technology to transform, manipulate, and transcend natural
          environmental limits. There isn’t a one-way correlation; instead, a
          culture develops a technology, such as agriculture, to change the
          environment, and this technology, in turn, changes the culture and
          society that created it. Kailum explores this closed loop by creating
          large-scale still and moving images that play with the ubiquitous
          dichotomies between physical and digital existence.

          <span style="background: #f3f9e6; padding: 5px">Q&A WITH KAILUM</span>
        </h2>
        <br />

          <h3>Why were you inspired to make this specific film?</h3>
          <br /><p>
          The inspiration for creating this specific film emerged from a series
          of recent events that ultimately confronted a lifetime of emotional
          pain. In an effort to grapple with and find acceptance for these
          experiences, I embarked on a deeply introspective journey, chronicling
          the entirety of my existence. This process revealed the core essence
          of my being, encompassing my consciousness, fears, vulnerabilities,
          and insecurities—an unfiltered representation of my soul.</p><br />
          <h3
            >Did anyone specific become critical to the creation of your film?
            Why do they stand out as significant to your film?</h3
          >
          <br /><p>
          Definitely, the support and connection I found with individuals who
          shared similar backgrounds and histories were absolutely critical to
          the creation of my film. These connections served as a powerful
          reminder that I wasn't navigating this journey in isolation. Their
          willingness to share their own experiences created a sense of
          solidarity that encouraged me to confront my own past and find
          strength in vulnerability. Furthermore, my artistic outlet was a
          significant factor in shaping the film. It provided a medium through
          which I could express emotions and experiences that felt nearly
          impossible to articulate with words alone. This artistic process
          helped me channel the complexity of my feelings into a tangible form,
          giving me a renewed sense of agency and a way to communicate with
          others on a profound level. Amidst the creation of the film, another
          pivotal development was my decision to begin Eye Movement
          Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for my complex
          post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). This therapeutic approach
          became an integral part of my journey, contributing to my healing and
          growth. It was during this time that I found myself increasingly
          capable of transcending the limitations that my past had imposed on
          me. The combination of artistic expression and therapy allowed me to
          redefine my existence on my own terms, reshaping my narrative and
          reaffirming my presence in a way that I never thought possible.
          </p><br />
          <h3
            >Were there any challenges or doubts you faced in the process? How
            did you address them?</h3
          >
          <br /><p>
          Absolutely, there were a multitude of challenges and doubts that I
          encountered throughout this process. Confronting the lingering impact
          of my childhood and adolescence on my self-perception was deeply
          daunting. The silence surrounding my past, which I had maintained even
          with those closest to me, was born from a potent blend of
          embarrassment and shame. <br /><br />
          Undertaking this project marked an endeavour to shed the layers of
          concealment and to bravely embrace my authentic self. Yet, amidst this
          journey, I grappled with the concern of being pigeonholed by my
          perceived vulnerabilities—trauma, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and
          depression. It was imperative to me that my narrative extended beyond
          these aspects, that they did not encapsulate the entirety of my
          identity. I recognised that my formative experiences, despite their
          difficulties, shaped me into the person I am today, a fact I came to
          accept and even embrace. </p><br />
          <h3>How does your true self shine through in your film?</h3>
          <br /><p>
          In my film, my true self shines through in its unfiltered
          authenticity. It's a raw and unvarnished reflection of my journey,
          where I've confronted my past and embraced my vulnerabilities head-on.
          Through the film, I've harnessed the power of artistic expression to
          communicate emotions and experiences that words alone struggle to
          convey. This genuine portrayal of my struggles, triumphs, and
          self-discovery stands as a testament to my resilience and willingness
          to be vulnerable. By revealing both the pain and the growth, the film
          encapsulates my true self – a person who refuses to be defined solely
          by past hardships but instead thrives in the process of redefining
          existence on my own terms.
          <br /><br />
          Crafting this film frame-by-frame has sparked a multitude of thoughts
          that I'm truly excited to weave into my forthcoming projects. In fact,
          I took on the challenge of crafting a 5-hour video, meticulously
          constructing each frame, to vividly portray the intricacies of Life,
          the Universe, and Everything. Upon completing this endeavor, I found
          myself captivated by the process and intrigued to explore this
          approach on a grander scale in my future endeavors.
