            <p>
              Welcome to the Fall 2020 issue of Volvox Vault: Proximity. This
              issue is all about nearness and farness from people, places,
              creativity, and more. We’re wondering, how does proximity impact
              your creative drive, social energy, interests, habits, and so on?
              I’ve been pondering a study which was done involving college
              students and a bowl of apple slices. It showed that when
              participants were closer to the apple slices, they ate
              significantly more of them [Gregory J. Privitera &#38; Heather E.
              Creary]. So, similar to how we’ll eat the apple when it’s within
              reach, when we’re in close proximity to other creatives: we create
              more. We need each other to learn from and be inspired by.
              Especially during an international pandemic, we need to get
              creative about how we come together. So here we are! There’s
              something incredibly uplifting about immersing yourself into a
              collection of diverse perspectives like this, yet somehow they all
              seem to come from the same universal consciousness. I hope you
              will find some comfort and inspiration in this issue, the times
              have been stressful. Imagine each piece as an apple slice from the
              same nutritious apple, and enjoy!

              “Pools.” is a personal effort to encapsulate the emotional drought
              of self isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, hoping to provide
              a sensual experience showcasing the spectrum of proximity through
              photography &#38; music. The photograph, taken by my partner,
              Hunter McNeil, showcases my interpretation of the spectrum of
              proximity. Together, touching, genuinely nearby, expressed by the
              couple skipping rocks, and apart, isolated, or alone, the
              emptiness which surrounds them. All of which I crave
              simultaneously. Paired with the composition, an eleven-minute
              personal response to the contrasting spectrum of proximity
              expressed through instrumentation. Together the visual, &#38;
              auditory aspects of this project provide an underlying sense of
              affection, &#38; intimacy within the pieces through the lens of
              proximity.

            <p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 18px">
              Lately I’ve become more aware of my habit of looking for home
              elsewhere. I am always thinking “Okay, in 2 years I’ll be in
              [location] doing [activity], and I’ll finally be happy.” That self
              promise of future happiness is sometimes all that I cling on to.
              Of course, this isn’t sustainable, because the closer I get to my
              perfectly envisioned future, the clearer it is to see that nothing
              changes just based on location. <br />
              When I was in San Francisco, I spent a lot of time thinking about
              Toronto. Now that I’m in Toronto, I spend a lot of time thinking
              about New York. I am constantly trying to find a place where I
              will miraculously be happy, instead of just building one within
              myself. I’m working on that, but in the mean time, I’ll keep
              daydreaming about my fantasy cottage in New Zealand...
