          I’m not sure that Volvox Vault would exist without the inspiration I
          found from exploring Elliott and Laurel's various projects, which I
          was lucky enough to surf across on the web somehow. Community websites
          like Special Fish, and the gentle conversations on HTML Energy
          introduced me to a simple &#38; calm, yet complex &#38; vast side of
          the internet. <br />I think a lot of people, probably especially those
          who don't make websites (if you don't, I encourage you to try it),
          often forget how special and thoughtful a 'hand-made' website can be.
          This interview turned out to be an insightful meditation that I
          personally found very helpful in the midst of continuing to develop
          volvoxvault.com, and that will energize you creatively as well.

            do you work together?</mark

          <mark class="both">Laurel &#38; Elliott say:</mark><br />

          Hi Tiana! We met 5 years ago. We were actually roommates in San
          Francisco first when Laurel was a visiting teacher at California
          College of the Arts for a semester. We didn’t know each other much at
          first, and at the time, Elliott was a pretty quiet roommate and was
          making many strange websites. Laurel was teaching interactive design,
          so there was similar ideas happening in close proximity. After that,
          Laurel returned to New York, and later Elliott did too. In 2016,
          Laurel was the creative director of
          <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/about/" target="_blank"
            >The Creative Independent</a
          >
          (which is published by Kickstarter) and brought on Elliott to help
          with design and web development there. We worked in the basement at
          Kickstarter in our own little bubble and drank lots of kombucha on
          tap. How we work together is somewhat of a mystery. It seems like we
          are vibing energies running in parallel, and sometimes we intersect.
          We also worked on
          <a href="https://emptyday.today/" target="_blank">Empty Day</a>
          together, and most recently
          <a href="https://html.energy/" target="_blank">HTML Energy</a>. We
          shared an art residency at

          <li>
            Things don’t have to be complete (websites are never complete) but
            they should achieve their goals and work (not break).
          </li>
          <li>Harness the power of HTML when possible.</li>
          <li>
            Community websites should have clearly defined moderation and take a

          </li>
          <li>
            Every website is a program for the mind. Social media is a good
            example of this. What kind of programs do we want to write for
            others to follow?

          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          A cleanse or fast every once in a while is good for anything that’s
          somewhat addictive… social media, food, alcohol, etc. It’s important
          to see clearly how we channel our energies, and regular cleanses help
          us do this.

          ><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          I’m fascinated by what happens when you open up a private website to
          the public and allow people to create their own pages, etc. All these
          social networks and apps that we use on a daily basis are just
          websites with databases at their most basic level. I think sometimes
          people lose sight of that. The web hasn’t really changed all that much
          from a technical standpoint. I’m fascinated that a tiny community
          website running on a home server and a giant social media website
          share many of the same technologies. It’s kind of beautiful and makes
          me feel like nothing is set in stone–there’s always alternative ways
          of being on the web.

          ><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          At first I was specifically trying to create an alternative social
          network. After it launched,
          <a
            href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:u1dLIH6Eaf4J:https://www.kickscondor.com/special.fish+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-b-d"

            >Kicks Condor</a
          >
          wrote about it on their website and called it “a big directory of
          people.” That really changed my perspective on the project. I realized
          my field of vision was too narrow. I ditched social media recently
          because it was training me to look at websites in a certain way.
          People talk a lot about social media’s adverse effects, but I don’t
          see this problem brought up. I suppose it only really impacts people
          building websites, but it leads to unfortunate outcomes nonetheless.
          So to answer your question, I think of Special Fish as a directory to
          explore the handmade web, websites that are hand crafted by real
          people and not by corporations. There are a lot of these sites out
          there but very few directories to find them, so Special Fish hopes to
          help with that.

            >Tiana: What is the relationship between your community websites and
            real life? How do these websites impact our real lives?</mark
          ><br />
          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          I’ve been thinking recently about how I feel in social spaces—physical
          and digital alike. I love when I’m in a room with other people, and I
          am in awe of everyone around and somehow absolutely believe that
          everyone present is a special, kind genius. I could imagine this
          happening, for instance, at a lecture that a friend is about to give
          and I’m talking with some people there, and even though I don’t know
          everyone, I’m excited by and respectful of everyone in the space. I
          also feel this way about most people on Special Fish, too. I think
          it’s because so many people put such thought and creative energy into
          their profiles. But that’s only possible because Elliott took special
          care and intention with the design—which is not just how it looks but
          also how it functions, what it requires of users. The design of
          Special Fish encourages its participants to put this effort forward.
          It’s a reciprocal relationship.
          <br /><br />
          But then there are other social spaces, both physical and digital,
          where I think everyone is kind of trash and superficial. Not always,
          but often Instagram affords this, as does certain IRL events
          pre-COVID, like some gallery openings. I just look around and have
          this feeling like everyone sucks in some way, and even if that’s not
          true on an individual level… somehow the energy of the event and
          social space feels unthoughtful and unfortunately doesn’t make me
          excited to interact with others. Something about the social space is
          too easy and not thoughtful. Maybe ultimately these spaces are not
          “for us”—Instagram uses its users’ posts as advertising to earn money,
          and gallery openings are often perfunctory events meant for social
          climbing.
          <br /><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          Agreed. I’m pretty glad that a lot of events have been canceled. At
          the beginning of quarantine, with so much communication switching to
          video chat, I think it was immediately evident that online could never
          really replace in-person interaction. There’s always some kind of
          energy missing when you’re on a call. It bothers me that these social
          networks are continually trying to replace in-person communication
          when they could be working on supporting preexisting forms of
          communication. I’d love to see more websites that support real world
          interaction. It was inspiring to see all these Google Docs being
          created during the recent Black Lives Matter protests. I think that’s
          a good example of websites impacting real lives.

            >Tiana: How do your community websites differ from popular social
            platforms?</mark
          ><br />
          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          Since they’re more clearly authored, often homespun community
          websites’ goals, rules, and moderation are more obvious. This makes
          sense since most of them spun out of being dissatisfied by the larger,
          more popular social platforms.
          <br /><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          Yeah the goals are pretty different when it comes to community website
          vs social media websites. One thing that separates them is the ability
          to experiment. When your metrics aren’t based on how long you can keep
          a user on a website, things really open up.

            <a href="http://gossips.cafe/" target="_blank">Gossip's Cafe</a>,
            you close the cafe at 11pm. <br />What is your philosophy behind a
            non-24/7 website?</mark
          ><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          I’ve always felt that websites should have grounding in the world.
          Sometimes this can happen through a feature or design choice, but it
          could also be quite literal like having open hours. When I started the
          cafe, I had this idea of literally turning off the website/server at
          the end of the day. Sort of like turning off the lights in a real cafe
          and locking up. I guess the current implementation is not that
          drastic, so it might be cool to actually turn off the server in the
          future :)
          <br /><br />
          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          Grounding a website in the world helps people understand that
          technology is man-made and literally comes from the earth. Like other
          things that come from the earth, it’s a resource that has limitations.
          Normally people understand websites to be up all the time, 24 hours a
          day, 7 days a week, because they imagine websites as ethereal and not
          tied to the physical world, when in fact they are.
          <br />
          This reminds me, I interviewed
          <a href="https://html.energy/marie.html" target="_blank"
            >Marie Otsuka</a
          >
          on HTML Energy about the solar-powered website she designed,
          <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/" target="_blank"
            >Low-Tech Magazine</a
          >. She said, “Just because things are digital doesn’t mean they’re
          more sustainable. There are servers that are powered by fossil fuels
          that serve up these digital documents.” Her visual design works in
          ways to make this underlying truth more apparent.

          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          It’s an ongoing conversation and movement about the famous “HTML,”
          also known as HyperText Markup Langauge. It’s also a podcast where
          we’ve talked to several web geniuses about how they go about creating,
          updating, and living their websites.
          <br /><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          Yeah, I like to think of it as a movement or fan club. I remember the
          name came from a conversation I had with Laurel once about energy. I
          asked her if she thought everything had energy and she said yes. So I
          started wondering if something nonphysical like a language could have
          energy. It’s nice to think of HTML as a means of transferring and
          storing energy between people.

          ><br />
          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          We like fast and lightweight websites. Making websites with only HTML
          enables this because HTML is universal to all websites. It’s the
          foundation. Unfortunately in 2020, a lot of people forget that, for
          example, adding unnecessary JavaScript that’s only for superficial
          polish actually adds a lot of weight to pages, sometimes making them
          unable to load on slow connections. This is especially sad when the
          website contains important, life-sustaining information that should be
          accessible to all humans.<br />
          With HTML Energy’s podcast, so far we've been talking to mostly
          individual designers and programmers, but we would love to talk with
          someone from a more government or public service organization
          perspective working on websites that optimize for people in areas with
          low bandwidth connections, for example. Let us know if you think of
          anyone.

          By interviewing people, we connect with other special, unique
          energies. — I love hearing how different each energy’s approach is.
          Especially now in 2020, there are so many tools out there to make a
          website, and honestly it can be overwhelming, and to boot, there can
          be a lot of
          <a href="https://www.are.na/block/7447577" target="_blank"
            >social pressure</a
          >
          around using tools that are currently trendy. So when we interview
          people, we get to hear specifically how they have used simple HTML and
          made websites in their own unique way. I love hearing the specific
          details and the origin stories especially. For example,
          <a href="https://html.energy/tom.html" target="_blank">Tom Bubul</a>
          made Dungeon and Dragons fan sites in the 90s. He didn’t even play the
          game, just invented his own scenarios as his way to play. And other
          people we interviewed such as
          <a href="https://html.energy/emma.html" target="_blank"
            >Emma Rae Norton</a
          >
          didn’t start coding websites until she was in college and still found
          her own creative way of approaching it for the first time by slowly
          coding by hand and embracing that slowness. Hopefully hearing these
          stories shows how anyone can approach HTML as a pliable and expressive
          creative medium… similar to more traditional mediums like clay, paper,
          paint, or even a musical instrument. And unlike most technology which
          is fast and efficient, such as anything we use quickly on our phones,
          we should actually consider embracing the clunkiness, slowness, and
          imperfection of HTML. Our guest
          <a href="https://html.energy/korede.html" target="_blank"
            >Korede Aderele</a
          >
          embraces “bugs” or things that don’t work as originally intended. “I
          figure it’s my personal website so I can do what I want with it. I’m
          fine with having a bug sit there for a while. Sometimes, I just leave
          a bug and let that become a weird, quirky feature.” <br /><br />
          Before HTML Energy started, I was very inspired by website hand-coder

          >
          saying making websites by hand is similar to older folk traditions.
          <br /><br />
          After we launched the podcast, at first we thought no one was
          listening. We had no way of knowing immediately since we didn’t put it
          on Soundcloud and didn’t have analytics on our pages… so we couldn’t
          see the play count or anything. But after a few months, we heard that
          a few people had listened to all the episodes, and were enjoying it.
          This delayed feedback feels nourishing somehow. The time elapsed
          between a message and its reply is an important part of the message
          itself.

          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          I think it has to do with transparency and wanting to show the
          underlying structure and not obscure things.
          <br /><br />
          <mark class="elliott">Elliott says:</mark><br />
          Yes, I think transparency is definitely important. I have a strange
          relationship with design because on one hand it can be a really
          important and useful tool for organizing information but it can also
          easily get in the way. An example of this is when people design for
          the web like they would for print. Things like web fonts and layout
          are nice but just get in the way if they don’t support the underlying
          content. Maybe a good analogy is a public library. In a library all
          the bookcases are designed to present books (information) without
          obscuring their titles or how many there are. Most modern websites
          feel like libraries with a few books on a table and all the other
          books tucked out of sight in storage. There might be a card catalog
          system for looking up titles, but sometimes that’s even missing. This
          seems like a big mistake in the long run because it’s putting design
          and engagement before information, exploring, and play.

          Most of my energy after writing that essay went into building the cafe
          and Special Fish. More recently, I’ve taken a step back and have been
          trying to observe more. After putting so much time into making things
          on the web, I’ve been feeling like I want to put more energy into
          things happening off the web. Maybe this goes back to your question
          before about how websites can impact real lives. I’m not sure what
          this would look like for me or for HTML Energy but it’s fun to think
          about.

            >Tiana: Any recommendations for people just starting out with HTML
            or building servers?</mark
          ><br />
          <mark class="laurel">Laurel says:</mark><br />
          While it might make sense to delay, I actually think it’s important to
          start using real web servers as soon as possible to truly understand
          how to build a website that’s fully online, and not some “toy
          project.”
          <br /><br />
          However, I also think it’s good to recognize that a website can still
          be a website even if it’s not publicly online, similar to how our HTML
          Energy guest
          <a href="https://html.energy/larissa.html" target="_blank"
            >Larissa Pham</a
          >
          made her first websites at her grandparents’ house. Larissa said, “I
          got into coding websites because I wanted to make a fan site for this
          manga series. None of it ever went live, but I learned how to write
          everything in a a notepad file (like a text file) and just save it
          with the `.html` extension and open it in my local browser. So I would
          mock up websites that way. I would read source code from other
          people’s sites to learn how to do things.” So in other words, a
          website is just a set of files, and one of those files should be
          readable by a web-browser (like the extension `.html`)—and it could
          even live only on your computer and still be a website. Larissa shows
          that you can enjoy making a website that is only for you… it doesn’t
          have to go online. <br /><br />
          It’s up to you whether or not to put your website online (that is,
          from your computer to a web-server). However, in my biased opinion, I
          think putting your website online, on a real web-server, is part of
          the essential magic of websites.
          <br /><br />
          With my students and clients, I usually recommend people start with a
          basic paid host (which rents you web-server space) such as
          <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/" target="_blank"
            >Nearly Free Speech</a
          >. This service is very clear about how it charges you. There are also
          no year-long binding contracts… it’s kind of like a gas meter, you put
          in money and it gradually runs out. So you can truly calculate how
          much your site costs you per day, if you like. It allows for PHP,
          which is useful if you have a Wordpress, Kirby, or some dynamic
          content. On the other hand, I think
          <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>
          is a good route for small, static websites, and it’s technically free…
          although note it’s owned by Microsoft.
