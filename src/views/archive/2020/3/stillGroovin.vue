          The World May Have Went Haywire, But We’re Still Groovin

        <p class="headDes">An Interview with Jerome Manguba by Em Biggs</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>D</strong>escribed as an opportunity to dive deeper, I was
          over the moon about interviewing my friend Jerome. Since meeting
          Jerome, he has always been someone who invests soulfully in whatever
          he does. By that I mean he is a hard worker, who is aware of the
          details of his involvement and wants to deliver on that. With Jerome
          currently attending Ryerson University for Fashion Design, working as
          an Apparel Design Intern for WIL Studios, and overall just being a
          cool dude… He has also come across another realm of his skillset,
          being Music Journaling!! <br />

            ><strong>Music Journaling:</strong> A journaling prompt that takes
            the form of written, verbal, or rhythmic dialogues. Perhaps writing
            lyrics based on emotion, arranging songs in a playlist or creating a
            mixed track as an extension of your feelings.<br
          /></em>
          For Jerome, this looks like regular journaling, though instead of a
          book to write in, he uses CD collections/digital music archives and a
          DJ controller to get out his thoughts, feelings, and moods.

          <strong>M</strong>aybe the lead up of this article should have been a
          description of his radio show on UMFM Radio, J-Soul. Or maybe we
          should have started with the part about how his music taste has jumped
          from album to album since shooting hoops in middle school. But we are
          here now, so let’s get into it! Feeling inspired by the ’90s and
          2000’s Hip-Hop and Neo-Soul tracks by D’Angelo, Erykah Badu, and
          Q-Tip. what Jerome is settling into and exploring these days is
          connected to those rhythms as well. Music Journaling is a relatively
          new practice for Jerome and in his latest mixes on SoundCloud, he
          links Modern with Neo-Soul history on a belt of analog and acoustic
          sounds. For him, creating these tracks helps him to bring out more of
          what he feels through music than in words.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>H</strong>e goes on to explain that there is tenderness and
          care when anyone talking to anyone speaks of music. Or
          friends/strangers that suggest to you a song.
          <strong>“Music is what keeps people in touch,”</strong> Jerome says. I
          find it interesting. In preparing for our interview and as I am
          writing this article now, I have been listening to the tracks Jerome
          has created to do just that. To keep in touch. Tell me, is it
          amplifying our work?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>R</strong>eflecting on what Music Journaling has meant for
          Jerome as an artist, he identifies the weaving he has done with his
          work in fashion. A ton of his designs are related to music. With
          physical creations, there is also an album or song connected. Or like
          in making an album, there is a similar articulation in designing an
          outfit. He says, “You need different variations to sum up an
          equivalent mood.” I may not be as smooth as Jerome’s transitions in
          his mixes but I’M LEARNING. So, let us switch tempos as we further
          chat about his experiences as an intern at WIL in Toronto.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>WIL</strong>. An acronym for ‘What I Like’, The company
          streams their energy between designing and selling clothing that is
          felt as playful but in a more mature way. The other half of WIL
          resides in their creative direction, collaborating with artists to
          make music videos, or whatever format they are looking to express.
          Whatever road WIL goes down, they offer “A progressive take on
          everyday silhouettes.” Many different individuals, from different
          backgrounds, are being represented at the forefront of their brand.
          Working with artists such as Daniel Caesar, Donte Colley, Charlotte
          Day Wilson, and Daniela Andrade. Jerome speaks on how the brand itself
          is focused on including everyone. Something in the works for a lot of
          brands right now is creating non-gendered sizing charts. Jerome
          further explains that diversity in fashion is pulling something off
          the rack and making it work in a flattering way for ALL people. He
          outlines the collaboration of time and great ideas necessary to come
          up with solutions to real issues of inclusivity in our current fashion
          industry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>A</strong>s we brainstormed ways to contribute solutions,
          Jerome offered this perspective:
        </p>
        <blockquote
          style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 200%; font-size: 20px"
        >
          “While designers and brands are continuously finding creative ways in
          being more inclusive, it’s important for consumers to buy product in
          sustainable ways and from brands based on their values. Invest in
          brands that have ethical practices and that create narratives that you
          can connect with.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Simply put, it is about the individual supporting the brand while the
          brand supports the community. Since COVID there has been a lot of time
          for brands to reflect and make changes to better support the
          communities they are approaching, while still maintaining and
          expanding their original intention to create.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="text-indent: 15px">
          <strong>A</strong>s artists, we create for ourselves, like a soft
          remedy as to a response to our experiences or even a pandemic. Maybe
          this looks like music journaling, drawing out sketches, or designing
          clothes. Or perhaps it is another modality. Yes, we create for
          ourselves, but we also create for others. When we share it helps other
          people to see that there is another option of doing things, creating a
          more dynamic and accepting approach to the systems we live in. Most
          importantly I think that creative expression shows us that we can
          change. That we can be playful and at the same time very capable of
          getting what we want out of life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="font-size: 10pt">
          Thank you to Jerome for sharing your perspectives and trusting me to
          write this piece. I am so grateful.
