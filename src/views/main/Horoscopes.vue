<p>♈︎<br><strong>A r i e s</strong> ~ Spring, that feeling in the air everyone talks about now, is what runs through my veins every day as an Aries. This is my season because for a moment, the world is on my page, eager to read and hear what I have to say. Rather than hoarding my magic, I share it. The world needs more examples and inspiration for possibilities of ways to live. My sovereignty is playful yet reliable and my youthful spirit is not taught but embodied. I do not leave my pleasure to be named by others. I find deep safety when I acknowledge which newness I would like to experience. Grounded in love and filled with vitality, I give myself permission to get in touch with my sensational nature. This spring I set my <b><i>flaunting</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/aries_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♉︎<br><strong>T a u r u s</strong> ~ Any insecurity I have experienced in the past or maybe am sifting through in the present day, I thank it for protecting me at those times and let go of it from obstructing my future. I welcome in a lucid understanding of my inner framework, not to bog me down but to actually activate a working relationship with my subtle energy. I am imperfect and it’s wonderful, it’s a pleasure to be different. Over the past moons, I know not to waste my time or dissipate my energy. I’ve gotten the pleasure to be with myself every night, through SO MUCH. Through the accumulated wisdom of these experiences and acceptance of mine own self. I know how to wish for things without doubt. This spring I set my <b><i>inner mystic</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/taurus_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♊︎<br><strong>G e m i n i</strong> ~ I trust that the friction I have been feeling will soon forge a new wave of thought and outlook on life for me. Perhaps I am allowing more and more space for my ability to change. Without this very natural chain of events (change, that is), we would all be mere shells of our 12-year-old selves. Which was exactly perfect for me at that time, but now I accept that things are different so that my younger self can thank me. So that my younger self can really root for me. Change does not come from standing still, change comes from my innate need to try new things and seeing where that takes me. I do not give up on myself because I am worth seeing this through. This spring I set my <b><i>persistence</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/gemini_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♋︎<br><strong>C a n c e r</strong> ~ “To give and receive with love, I set my feelings free. I am open” I repeat this to myself every morning and every night. I’ve been through it the last few months and can now clearly see the narratives I have been contributing to. This season I jump into self-doubt and uncertainty and blow it up from the inside out. I release my grip and meet each tender ache with love and understanding. If I want to know where I am going and how to get there, I have to stop looking to others to tell me how to feel about a situation. In other words, I have to start getting to know myself. I have to stop expecting myself to be perfect for everyone else. So, “to give and receive with love, I set my feelings free. I am open…” This spring I set my <b><i>liberty</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/cancer_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♌︎<br><strong>L e o</strong> ~ What makes me question my ability to receive what is being offered? When I choose to be introspective in contrast to perpetuating fantasy I am able to surrender into impartial love. I resist over-intellectualizing my experience and allow my body to naturally purge. If I do have a mental urge, I will simply ask myself “what is at the root of any thoughts or obstruction?” That is all, my body will do the rest, in this I trust. There is an importance now to have a non-interpretive practice about how I feel. In other words, just let myself be, knowing that I am oh so held. I am awakening and in awe of the way my body moves, breathes, naturally cleanses, loves and creates. This spring I set my <b><i>acute awareness</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/leo_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls  >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♍︎<br><strong>V i r g o</strong> ~ I can take up space without feeling as though I am taking away from others. What masks do I put on for the world around me to make them feel comfortable? Have I considered the possibility that the right people, places, and opportunities will be magnetized to me regardless of what part of me is exposed? Maybe my love language isn’t so hard to speak. Maybe all I’ve had to do is embody this language so there is less translating to achieve. Perhaps I have just been concentrating too hard on what isn’t for me rather than what is. Today I open up a new commitment of choosing to participate according to my gifts. This spring I set my <b><i>radical candor</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/virgo_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♎︎<br><strong>L i b r a</strong> ~ Honest love works on every system of the body. If I want to look for inspiration, I don’t have to look further than the strength within me – I have gotten this far already. Someone once said that pain is a moment between two pleasure points and pleasure is a moment between two points of pain. There is no super-secret antidote that will protect against feeling pain ever again. Though, I can remind myself that life is working for me, not to me/against me. I have a say in this, I always have and maybe it has just taken a second for me to remember. I see my emotions as messengers and I am willing to see any mistakes as lessons. As I tend to my sensitive heart, forgiveness frees me. This spring I set my <b><i>uplifting affirmations</i></b> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/libra_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♏︎<br><strong>S c o r p i o</strong> ~ What I choose to focus on influences the framework of the world around me. I have reached the finality of a certain way of thinking. It’s made me unravel to a point where I really need some rest. I need to turn inward, in whatever capacity I can to gather new ideas and be receptive to what my body and journey is telling me. During this time, if I find myself replaying memories, it is the love instead of the hurt of these moments that I will attune to. I don’t need to rush through this process, the Universe has a funny way of bending around me when I need it the most. I give my attention to one direction and will thank myself in the future for doing so. This spring I set my <i><b>reliable self-care routines</b></i> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/scorpio_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♐︎<br><strong>S a g i t t a r i u s︎</strong> ~ There’s a difference between what is settled and what lays dormant. Settled meaning a road that I have been down before many, many times, certain as to where it goes. Dormant meaning something is yet to be activated, sitting in the wings, awaiting a catalyst. If I could fuel one new approach, venture, dream… What would it be? I was born with expansive Jupiter energy in my cosmic blood for goodness sake. I have to fully commit though. It should be a goal of mine to make my work sustainable. I’m learning to encourage myself to keep going even when it’s easier to go back to how I’ve always done things. I am enough and my energy is limitless. This spring I set my <i><b>timely activation</b></i> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/sagittarius_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♑︎<br><strong>C a p r i c o r n</strong> ~ I’ve felt like I’ve been grabbing at loose straws lately. I remind myself that I am worthy, and that I do not have to prove myself constantly to the world around me. I can take breaks from picking sides, having it together for others all the time; and honestly, I’ve just had enough. I will learn more of my values by allowing myself to just be. The more I open my heart to that feeling the more I am free. It seems simple in theory but I challenge myself to put it into practice. I will have more to share in due time but for now I trust that I am being called to take some space to reassess, reframe, and even grieve if I need to. This spring I set my <i><b>own nourishment</b></i> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/capricorn_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♒︎<br><strong>A q u a r i u s</strong> ~ I consider practices that I know I can let loose in, like how good humour and good friends have always made me feel at ease. Events in my recent past showed me about life’s woes, and while teary-eyed/intense, it is important for me to remember that I am not alone.  If anything, I can bet on the parts of myself that are opening up through this because I am no longer sheltered. I am safe of course, but I am no longer avoiding unpleasant realities for the sake of simply not wanting to be too vulnerable emotionally. My first steps after these shifts have taken place may feel like I am on a teeter totter… But! I remind myself that I can get off to take a break, or go slower as I eventually come to a balance. This spring I set my <i><b>unravelment</b></i> in motion.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/spring2021/aquarius_spring.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls >Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♓︎<br><strong>P i s c e s</strong> ~ My mind is beautiful; my body is beautiful and I love to have FUN!!! In the past, I may have been taken advantage of because for my love of others and while grueling, I have learnt from each heartache. I have gained a perspective of my non-negotiables in life and relationships. The thing is, people love boundaries. They tell us how we want to be seen and treated by others so that the relationship can not only exist, but thrive. I realize the containers I would like to create for all kinds of relationships to take place in. May I be surprised by the transformation of my connections and confidence as I dismantle existing structures that are no longer nourishing. I am supported, loved, and respected. This spring I set my <i><b>new-found philosophy</b></i> in motion.</p>

<p><em>NEW - written in affirmation style and meant to serve you in whatever way you need.</em></p>

<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px dashed;">

<p>♈︎<br><strong>A r i e s</strong> ~ I will give a voice to what has been waiting in the wings to be seen and heard. There are parts of me that I may not understand yet and this excites me. Like any good story there is character development. May I trust that parts of my life can be curated specially for my own growth. The roots of any conflict dissipate as I allow for other perspectives and contemplations to enhance my story. Certain emotions may come up that I don’t know what to do with. This is okay, because I am curious to explore new territories. Here’s to me, taking the key and unlocking a door never before opened.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/aries_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♉︎<br><strong>T a u r u s</strong> ~ I let go of the connections that make me feel strained and squished. Relationships that have some growing room are what I need to see myself clearly. They help me to witness where I have put up blockades around love in an effort to try and control it. I’ve cultivated something deep with myself and when I join forces with what and who I choose, we are in a good position to spread joy beyond the collaboration. The world needs this right now and maybe I do too. I don’t wish to be perfect at this time, nor do I wish for anyone else to be. I’m learning and I ask for the exchanges that encourage compassion from the heart and putting my own creative spin on things.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/taurus_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♊︎<br><strong>G e m i n i</strong> ~ This Sagittarius Season I will reconnect with the ‘why’ in what I do. The last while has been fast paced, disorienting at times and I can empathize with why I want to skip to the next part already. The part where my eyes don’t feel glazed anymore as my body adjusts to change. But there is so much I learn through self-effort and the experience of seeing myself through this. There has been an exceptional amount of things I’ve had to juggle, but I owe it to myself to meet myself where I am at. This season may I realize that my thoughts are meant to be bonds, not binds. I see the clouds parting for me and the Sun on my skin re-instills a sense of hope.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/gemini_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♋︎<br><strong>C a n c e r</strong> ~ I have everything I need to finish what I started. In fact, I witness and pay respect to how I naturally find a way to build with the materials I have. I ground down into being process oriented right now rather than results oriented. This allows for my creativity to come out and play while releasing the tension in my body that I need to let go of. There isn’t anything wrong with wanting to be seen. The world wants to get to know me too. What I am doing is enough, I understand that confidence in my output helps me see the closure available in each moment. May I be present in my actions and efforts and reassess my boundaries about how much I take on.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/cancer_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♌︎<br><strong>L e o</strong> ~ This season I will recognize the challenges of my past that have enriched and strengthened me. For there are certain experiences that have added fuel to my fire and resources to my toolkit. I will have markers for myself so that I can understand when I’m feeling burnt out. When I need a break. It’s okay to wish for emotional health and stability. I work steadily, thoughtfully and compassionately. Especially towards myself. I will ask for what I need and deserve. There are so many subtleties experienced at once. This momentum is all the permission I need to explore the expression of who I am in all of my value, lovability and resourcefulness.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/leo_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♍︎<br><strong>V i r g o</strong> ~ May I settle into an understanding that whatever move I make will inevitably bring me closer to myself. Sometimes things turn upside down so that I can explore my current limitations and perspectives. May I remind myself that I will move out of treacherous waves and into more serene waters eventually. I trust that there is time to work out any ‘kinks’ and I honour that nothing is ever perfect. What I perhaps underestimate is this process will be an inspiration for myself and others in the future. What matters right now is me doing my inner world justice, withdrawing if I need. This time hatches the egg for me to experience a different depth than what I am used to.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/virgo_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♎︎<br><strong>L i b r a</strong> ~ May I give more awareness to what double takes my attention. The trial and error periods of the last months have helped me invite in ways to work smarter and direct my energy in healthy currents. I will nurture this momentum by consistently checking in. Posing the question “what is it that I can do right now” eases any emotional wounds around what it means to try. I will honour the moments to take a step back to see if I can fill all of my cups from one overflowing well. Reassessment doesn’t mean failure. Reassessment brings movement to how I see things and allows for the opportunity to see the next step before I make my next move.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/libra_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♏︎<br><strong>S c o r p i o</strong> ~ I invite in reality checks around where my energy/thoughts have been going. My body will tell me when too much focus has me feeling dry, parched and unsure. May I not be frightened by this, instead welcome in an opportunity to adapt. It’s a vulnerable position to think for myself and still desire relating to others. But I want to. I’m beginning to see the certain magic I bring to my relationships. What makes them strong and enduring. Connection is meant to uplift my spirits. May I invite in the people and places that feel like home. When I feel comfortable, I can mindfully and intricately create the world around me.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/scorpio_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♐︎<br><strong>S a g i t t a r i u s︎</strong> ~ May I be motivated to do and go forth, affirming the ideas I believe in. This isn’t the beginning for me, more so a reflection of where I have been and a recognition of all the change I have gone through. I realize that the things I hope for at this time require a certain diligence from me. May I soften into what feels like it is worth my time and energy. With so much shifting around me I commit to actions that remind me of the strongest parts of myself. It’s my season and may I adorn myself in any way I see fit. Whether that be through outfits, scents, giggles, etc. I am enchanting, mystic, and metamorphosing.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/sag_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♑︎<br><strong>C a p r i c o r n</strong> ~ I take full responsibility for my choices and ask for help in fulfilling my commitments when I need to. I notice when things feel heavy but this doesn’t mean they have to weigh me down. Perhaps the pressure crystalizes me into the diamond that I am becoming. May I laugh a little lighter and focus on what I can control. Every so often we get to enjoy moments of feeling complete and that is so, so, sweet. It may not be fully in my awareness of what has shifted, but something has and it is altering my reality for the better. This season I will communicate how I see the world. My visions are valued.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/cap_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♒︎<br><strong>A q u a r i u s</strong> ~ It’s my time to commit to the people, places, and things that feel like a breath of fresh air. I trust my boundaries and those expressed to me as the container for expression between myself and everything else. Reconnection helps to warm up any icy feelings, so let’s get that fire burning. I settle into life’s pleasures in whatever way feels good to me now. When I leave doubt at the door, I can live from an honest place. No strings attached, I arrive with presence and this allows me to give freely and from the heart. In turn, this act heals me too. This season is meant to serve as a burst of new life, putting that spark back.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/winter2020/aquarius_sag2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♓︎<br><strong>P i s c e s</strong> ~ It’s up to me to see that the compassion I give myself is closely related to the compassion I give to others. It is in relationships that we heal the most, so may my connection with those I care for revive the parts of me that I may have forgotten. This might bring up a lot of what I have repressed, but I trust that I will allow for the space to accept where I am at. Life may be strange and bizarre as the world shifts, and I let go from this obscure tug of war. It is in this that I understand that I am not meant to suffer. I am Pisces and I will do my best to openly enjoy life’s pleasure’s even if I have experienced restrictions in the past/present.</p>

<h1>fall 2020 horoscopes ☽</h1>

<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px dashed;">

<p>♈︎<br><strong>A r i e s</strong> ~ Sometimes after an issue we are left with imagining what else is possible. All is not lost though. An option whenever you feel good about it is to give yourself space for creative visualization. What scene do you find yourself in, do you look/feel the same? Is there a possibility of integrating these details into your life? You may feel as though you are actively and constantly juggling two things this month. Check yourself out of any drama or gossiping in October. However, and only you can answer this, if something is truly getting to you, you don’t have to pretend that it isn’t. What I think is so special about your energy is how you always offer to teach and counsel others with the tools you have. You are the authentic fire Aries, not the person dancing around it.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/fall2020/ariesOct2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♉︎<br><strong>T a u r u s</strong> ~ This month try to notice when you feel busy without purpose. By purpose, I don’t mean a seismic definition of what your life means. I simply mean that with every task, do it with the understanding that it matters. Ask yourself… At the core of it, what does matter to you? Be aware that what is profitable is not always ethical so watch out for when your benefit overrides those simple values too. Honor wherever you are in your cycle. This phase of your life is coming directly out of past experience. Take time to be with unprocessed feelings and unconscious beliefs. It’s okay to take moments to clear your head and hold off on conclusions. Illusions are disappearing and what is needed from you, for you, is gentle generosity as you shift.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/fall2020/taurusOct2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♊︎<br><strong>G e m i n i</strong> ~ When we tune into Gemini energy, a lot of astrologers will talk about the duality of this sign. Yes, there’s no doubt that you can juggle a ton, harness the ability to see both sides, and embrace oppositions. That is not in question. But, how can we aim that energy inwards? How can we get from the point of seeing this contrast of events outside of us, to another where we can see and remedy what has been going on under the surface? Try to start a dialogue with yourself in October if you haven’t already. With this leverage, you may tap into your 3 realities of the past, present, and future. If your friend was in the same position, how would you speak to them? Do you trust them? When you take off a mask it’s easier to see where you are stepping.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/fall2020/geminiOct2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♋︎<br><strong>C a n c e r</strong> ~ I see you. I see how you have been disciplining your energy and this has allowed you to help yourself and others. At this point, you can’t stand to see your energy stagnant. What you want, you want right NOW! I hope that you take this month to get excited about these sensations, emotions, and basic drives. Sometimes excitement builds up enough that we forget we still have a choice, commitments, and our very own will to conduct this energy. SO, if and when you are feeling the heat of a moment, know that you are allowed to take a step back and take a deep breath. The opportunities won’t slip away. What this means is YOU, giving yourself the space to envision the best possible expression of a scenario… Then when you’re ready, proceed with caution and a listening ear to make your dreams come true.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/fall2020/cancerOct2020.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♌︎<br><strong>L e o</strong> ~ Sparkles. Your inner light shines outwards. A recent harsh truth or heartache is being remedied. The weaving of events and interactions you take part in this month shows you how you would like to be cared for. Respect the receptivity it takes to draw others into a quiet tenderness. Notice if certain love or pleasure feels addicting or oppresses the Spirit. It isn’t love if you lose sight of yourself in the process of fulfilling someone else’s expectations of you. So, communicate, recognize deep feelings, and sense your gifts of self to another. As well, there was a powerful visualization of water that came through in your reading. Bathe babe. Water doesn’t have to be the medium of your immersion either. Forest bathe, music bathe, bathe in flowers… or all of the above. I trust your creativity in cleansing and revitalizing your energy when you feel the need to.</p>

<p>♍︎<br><strong>V i r g o</strong> ~ Listen and analyze from all angles and leave room for YOUR freedom before you take on more responsibility. How might we slow down observance so that we can collect the details and messages that we need? Connect with like-minded Spirits if you can. This will be great for your nervous system. You are appreciating your own patterns and bridging the gap between this day and the next. If something this month doesn’t go as you hoped, don’t believe for a second that this means you have to settle. No, no, no! Remedy any hurt if it comes up and try another approach when you feel ready. Have your pen stay hovered over that signature line as long as you need to. An honest commitment is the best kind of bond we can make.</p>

<p>♎︎<br><strong>L i b r a</strong> ~ Your horoscope this month felt like writing a sweet affirmation aw! The pieces and lessons that came in for you this September were significant. Last month you faced a ton of tasks to allow further weaving of your web. Please do not doubt where you were, where you are, and where you are going. This month you may feel your mind cut to distant snapshots to all of the future projects or successions with what you have been working on. Allow your mind to wander here if you can to gather and fuel up on inspiration. This is brilliant and supportive energy whenever you would like to tap into it! Collecting the twigs and mud so to speak to create your nest. This will be hard work… But may you never grow tired or impatient of the process, and may abundance naturally follow!</p>

<p>♏︎<br><strong>S c o r p i o</strong> ~ A sudden directedness and the inspiration you feel after watching a really good movie. I get this sense that you are moving on. Respect your body as a vehicle and keep it well. I get it, saying yes to one thing means saying no to another. Change of focus is healthy for you right now. You may feel the desire for different experiences, not for anyone else but for you to develop a different confidence about yourself. Magnetism comes from this sureness. Don’t doubt this development and let things flow through you without greed or grabbing. If it feels right, set some small goals for yourself, and find peace in quiet fulfillment. In your treasured relationships, let them know you care. They would really like to know.</p>

<p>♐︎<br><strong>S a g i t t a r i u s︎</strong> ~ What you find out about yourself this month will be teachings you will use for yourself and others later in life. You’re not always one for self-reflection but when it counts, you always show up. I feel as though more and more attention is being brought to your emotions, triggers, and instinct. This will bring knowledge on how to work with your energy in really beneficial ways! You may not see immediate progress but I promise, there are so many things working, healing, and mending for you right now. I appreciate your sense of always wanting to learn and get to the truth. Contemplate on your unique strengths. Coming in contact with them no matter how subtle has the power to change your whole day.</p>

<p>♑︎<br><strong>C a p r i c o r n</strong> ~ After trial and error, are you leaving room to experience mystery? Here is some food for thought. At what cost are your feelings negotiated when figuring things out on an intellectual basis alone? To form healthy understandings of your reality, we must free ourselves from limiting mentalities. You are a resourceful genius in both mind and body. A pilgrimage is a journey usually to unknown and foreign places. See where the urge takes you despite the knowledge of the destination. Whatever new perspectives that are realized in October, please trust that they have the ability to sustain themselves. This month my hope for you is that you find pleasure in realizing that you have more than enough, just by Being.</p>

<p>♒︎<br><strong>A q u a r i u s</strong> ~ A separation or ending of some kind has occurred. The energy this month is to assist in helping those who are no longer where they were and not yet where they are hoping to go. Tap into this if you feel called to. You know that you cannot take shortcuts and when you are ready, you will find the best course of action to take. Take some time out for a mini-vacation, even if that simply means stepping outside for only a moment. Do what you need to gather your energy. You will become aware that whatever you are leaving behind, wasn’t going to be fulfilling anyway. What you can count on during this month, and what will last, is your ability to add creative details to your overall vision.</p>

<p>♓︎<br><strong>P i s c e s</strong> ~ Things are never set in stone. The timing may feel off which can feel discouraging at times, but again nothing. Is. Ever. Set. In. Stone. Things are always in flux. While doing your reading, I kept getting the same feeling I would have after writing a test. My answers at the moment seem confident, then when receiving feedback afterward I would wish I could write that test again. You can only know what you know at a given time. I hope this eases your heart a bit and helps return some strength to you. We do our best with the information we have. You are changing in relation to something you don’t have control over. Be around uplifting friends or things now. If you need closure from somewhere, ask for it if you can.</p>

<h1>summer 2020 horoscopes ☽</h1>

<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px dashed;">

<p>♈︎<br><strong>A r i e s</strong> ~ I have three ‘S’ words for you this month Aries! Sunken in, Surreal, and Sobering. There’s been much to juggle over this last bit and you may find yourself wanting to shut the world out. Creating four walls however and wherever you can to hold you at this time, will keep you from blending into your surroundings. Pull back to return to yourself. Your attention is being casted to a deeper place. You cannot name joy unless you have experienced it yourself. So, your resolutions to what you are facing are something you have already experienced. Confidence in the newness of an environment vs. confidence in your experience are two different perspectives. Both offer a fresh look. Naivety dressed to look wise.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/aries.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♉︎<br><strong>T a u r u s</strong> ~ It’s a great time to ask for help if you need, even if it’s just a short phone call or text to a friend. Valuable lessons are being learnt about your drive to create and how you manage the longevity of your relationship with creation. Nothing is permanent and any feelings of being scattered will settle in time. The work you do is not only for you, but also to help others. I think that is so admirable. Don’t rush it though. You need to absorb all the nourishment of this process. Imagine that wherever you are in life, we can still be learning the basic nutrients of that version of ourselves. Drink in the potent calm of the cocoon you are in. A caterpillar and a butterfly have two different guidebooks. We are wise for a moment and then know nothing at all.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/taurus.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♊︎<br><strong>G e m i n i</strong> ~ You’re not going to be at home much, let me just say that as this horoscopes ice breaker. The motivations you’ve been feeling under the surface finally have a time to play out. This month there will be opportunity to acknowledge any regrets, redemption, and forgiveness. As you integrate broken pieces, listen to the voice that keeps begging for your attention. Crossroads only come up to show you that you have a choice. That you embody choice. If you are considering making big changes in your life, I certainly encourage it! Regardless, daily journaling may help you to see where you are coming from at a given time. Reading/Listening to those passages back in the future will feel like an old friend who knows your inner soul.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/gemini.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♋︎<br><strong>C a n c e r</strong> ~ Think of this month as sugary and sweet thoughts being all the sustenance you need to keep going. Like gentle breadcrumbs, with something tangible just around the corner. Having the whole pie right now would be hard to digest. So, breaking things into pieces, generating energy, and not getting too hung up on timing will hopefully put your heart at ease. You are in the process of drawing your arrow backwards. Keeping an open mind to wherever that arrow lands will allow for what you can control. Trust in positive developments and romance. It may be difficult to see where these crumbs lead… But know that you have the skills to dream up the world you would like to live in.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/cancer.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♌︎<br><strong>L e o</strong> ~ In certain complex situations you often know how to act. However, our minds can easily become overworked. It is rare for us to consider how stimulated we really are. Take some time this month to get to know your core values, again, and then again after that. Notice any reliance on sarcasm to negate any resentments or hidden truths. Being supportive, kind and consistent to yourself will help you to respect your process in the future. Then when you feel ready, define your thoughts and create a plan. It’s okay to take a break too. Deciding not to do anything is still a valid decision. Sometimes it feels like we are just getting by, but please know that our visions and voices are connected beyond what we see. This is the heat that heals.</p>

<p>♍︎<br><strong>V i r g o</strong> ~ Hi Virgo babies ~ a loving season to you, mercurial musings. I’m sensing the end of something that has caused stress or pain for you in the past. Please know that peace and strength is available to all, no matter where you are at. That healing lasts for however long you need so don’t feel like you have to be (x) better in an (x) amount of time. Speaking of needs, it’s best that you take care of yours. Like unbuttoning that top button after a big meal. Instinctual care. This month, going back to the basics of where you are directing your time and energy will signify a new beginning. You are your own living mascot of transformation. Further down the road, use these moments as a marker of how far you have come. Welcome in friendships that allow you to feel present and still.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/virgo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♎︎<br><strong>L i b r a</strong> ~ You recognize that your own needs are not cut off from those of others. At the same time, you aren’t looking for others to congratulate you before moving forward. I love this for you, as it seems you are trusting and seeing your own magnitude and that feels incredibly secure. You have the power to get what you want through the strength of your mind and force of your will. Don’t hesitate to ask for help along the way. This is a good month to explore magical helpers such as…But not limited to… Tarot, intentionally anointing yourself with your fav scent, caring for plants, or even the way you stir your coffee. (Clockwise to bring something into your life, counter-clockwise to let go.) Count on some vivid dreams, your desire being strong. Right now, preparing for the future is being in the present moment.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/libra.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♏︎<br><strong>S c o r p i o</strong> ~ There are areas of your life that seem to be competing for your time. If you can, try not to focus on events unresolved. You can’t feel balanced all of the time and that’s okay. The best thing you can do at this time is to come clean about how you feel so that everyone can heal. You’ve always known about your presence being the catalyst for change and regeneration. Honesty and forgiveness will help you to stop looking outside of yourself for the answers. Wanting to flip to other pages in your life’s book I think is natural. Maybe the adventure or suspense you are craving begins when you fall asleep from the waking world. Pay attention to those dreams right now. Take whatever time you need to think, reflect, to belong. Soon the question of “what are you trying to tell me???” Will turn into “Wow, I knew this all along.”</p>

<p>♐︎<br><strong>S a g i t t a r i u s︎</strong> ~ Decisions between what is familiar and the unknown. Take a step back, specifically on a mental plane if you can, to remind yourself why you do the things that you do. Within you is a well of endless energy. This doesn’t mean you always have to funnel that energy into something linear. Obviously easier said than done. Respect your own personal process. I am here to gently remind you that every moment is worth savouring, sometimes twice. Go back and revise wherever you feel necessary. This month is meant to show you which outside pressures make it difficult to remember your original purpose. Check in. Keep it simple. You got this!</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/sagittarius.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♑︎<br><strong>C a p r i c o r n</strong> ~ I feel as though you want to be seen by someone or something, yet at the same time deny the pleasure of it. Why is that? Maybe you have felt you were being pulled in two different directions or that small disagreements felt like strong insults. Relationships are meant to break down the walls of what we think we can control. Over time, you have gathered the information to decide on something with your full heart and trust. You’ve been letting this opportunity ripen and baby, it’s about to be harvest time. Whatever or whoever you are considering, you are sprouting from mutual love. It will soon feel like every part of your world is working in accordance with your movement. How you interact with these situations will show you more of who you are.</p>

<p>♒︎<br><strong>A q u a r i u s</strong> ~ I think we all dislike being put into a box, especially you Aquarius. Exciting life transitions are wanting to make themselves available to you. Take to the idea that some moments preserve themselves. An enclosed space of juicy and worthwhile immersion is not a box. You are supported from all sides. There is no intention of tying you in, in fact the opposite. You are letting go of any binds this month, becoming aware of your limiting thought patterns and loosening the grip of self-judgement. This may be from the aftermath of a conflict. There is a current of meaningful and enduring relationships present or coming for you. Feelings bottle up when we continue whining at doors already closed. Look to new love and ideas that come from the heart. Facing yourself has been the antidote to your own liberation.</p>
<audio src="@/assets/horoscopes/summer2020/aquarius.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br>

<p>♓︎<br><strong>P i s c e s</strong> ~ You’ve grown tired of the things that you know. Something has changed and it is altering your reality for the better. Maybe you have gotten more in touch with the root of yourself. The place where compassion begins and extends outwards. You are in the process of moving on from what you were unsatisfied with. Let what you see and feel be said, the force of your ideas demand to be expressed. This doesn’t have to be verbal either. Whatever your comfortability, or modality. It’s not about who hears them, more so it’s about You giving yourself a chance. The last few months have been a gathering of tools to help you navigate stress to, with time, come out the other side. You know how people harness superhuman strength in situations where their adrenaline kicks in? This month, in your own way, that is YOU.</p>
